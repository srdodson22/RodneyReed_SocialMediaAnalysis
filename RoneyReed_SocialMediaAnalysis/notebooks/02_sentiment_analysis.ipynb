Shortly after the Sacketts filled the lot with sand and gravel, the EPA notified them that the property contained wetlands subject to protection under the Clean Water Act and ordered them to remove the fill and restore the property to its natural state. Instead, the Sacketts sued the EPA, contending that the agency’s jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act does not extend to their property.\\n\\nThe central conflict of [Sackett v. EPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sackett_v._Environmental_Protection_Agency_\\(2012\\)) is whether a plurality decision by the Supreme Court in 2006 ([Rapanos v. United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapanos_v._United_States\\))) should be adopted to allow wetlands to be regulated only when they themselves have a continuous surface water connection to regulated waters. The EPA argues that wetlands separated from other waters of the United States by barriers are accurately defined as wetlands under protection of the Clean Water Act.\\n\\nReal life example: At least 20% of the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska is isolated wetlands. If the Supreme Court rules in favor of the Sacketts, this important and unique ecosystem will no longer be under federal protection.\\n\\nFurther reading: [Amicus brief](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/21/21-454/228197/20220616165114020_WOTUS%20Waterkeeper%20Amici%20FINAL.pdf) by Waterkeeper organizations. “Over one hundred environmental and community groups urge U.S. Supreme Court to uphold federal clean water protections,” [NRDC](https://www.nrdc.org/media/2022/220617).\\n\\n---\\n---\\n\\n#Voting rights\\n\\nOn the second day of the 2022-2023 term, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in [Merrill v. Milligan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrill_v._Milligan), a case that could further degrade the Voting Rights Act.\\n\\nMerrill v. Milligan originated from a challenge to Alabama’s 2020 redistricting cycle congressional map. A coalition of civil rights organizations and Alabama voters alleged that the plan is an unconstitutional racial gerrymander because race was the predominant consideration when creating numerous districts, and that the plan as a whole was enacted with the intent and the result of diluting African-American voting strength in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. \\n\\nIn February 2022, the Supreme Court [suspended](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/02/merrill-v-milligan-section-2-voting-rights-act-racial-redistricting-supreme-court.html) a lower court’s order to draw at least two districts “in which Black voters ... have an opportunity to elect a representative of their choice,” and scheduled oral arguments for the new term. Alabama asks the Court to invent a new test to determine if a map is racially gerrymandered—a test that, coincidentally, will be near impossible for voters and civil rights groups to satisfy. \\n\\n---\\n---\\n\\n#Death penalty\\n\\nThe Supreme Court already has a high-profile death penalty case on its schedule: [Reed v. Goertz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Reed), centering on Texas’ refusal to conduct DNA testing to confirm Reed’s guilt or clear his name.\\n\\nRodney Reed, a Black man, was convicted in 1998 for the abduction, rape, and murder of Stacey Stites, a white woman, by an all-white jury. The most damning evidence against Reed was DNA matching Reed collected from her body. However, Reed and Stites had a consensual sexual relationship at the time and he admits to having sex with her the day before her death. At the time of the trial, prosecutors allegedly [concealed](https://innocenceproject.org/for-23-years-prosecutors-illegally-hid-evidence-that-could-have-exonerated-rodney-reed/) statements from Stite’s co-workers that proved the pair were romantically involved.\\n\\n&gt;At trial, prosecutors repeatedly told Mr. Reed’s jury — falsely — that investigators “talked to all these people, and not one of them … ever said she was associated with that defendant. Ever. They weren’t dating according to anyone, there weren’t friends, they weren’t associates.”…\\n\\n&gt;On June 25, 2021, the State disclosed for the first time to Mr. Reed’s lawyers that Suzan Hugen, a friend and co-worker of Ms. Stites, gave a statement to police that she saw Mr. Reed and Ms. Stites at the H.E.B. where the women worked and she introduced Mr. Reed to Ms. Hugen as a “good or close friend.” Ms. Hugen told police that Ms. Stites and Mr. Reed appeared “friendly, giggling, and flirting.” …Two other H.E.B. co-workers of Ms. Stites also told police that Mr. Reed and Ms. Stites knew each other. These pre-trial interviews were not disclosed to Mr. Reed’s attorneys for 23 years,  until the eve of the July, 2021 evidentiary hearing.\\n\\nFurthermore, Jimmy Fennell, Stacey’s fiancé, was the prime suspect in the case. Friends and witnesses have since come forward and given testimony that Fennell provided inconsistent accounts of his whereabouts on the night of the murder and allegedly made threats on Stites’ life.\\n\\nReed’s execution has already been postponed numerous times, including once at the request of a bipartisan group of 16 Texas state senators. Reed is asking the Supreme Court to order DNA testing on the murder weapon, which has never been tested. \\n\\n---\\n---\\n\\n#Indian Child Welfare Act\\n\\nThe last scheduled case for the 2022-2023 term, so far, is [Haaland v. Brackeen](https://ballotpedia.org/Haaland_v._Brackeen). It is a complex case that could ultimately result in the Indian Child Welfare Act being declared unconstitutional.\\n\\nCongress passed the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) in 1978 to provide tribal governments with a voice in the removal and out-of-home placement of Native American children. Prior to the ICWA, many Native American children were forcibly taken away from their parents and extended relatives under the power of the federal government and placed in predominantly non-Native homes, which had no relation to Native American cultures. \\n\\nHaaland v. Brackeen involves numerous non-Native couples who wanted to adopt Native children but were opposed by the respective tribal governments. Texas, Louisiana, and Indiana joined the couples to ask the courts to declare the ICWA unconstitutional. District Court Judge Reed O’Connor, a George W.

Shortly after the Sacketts filled the lot with sand and gravel, the EPA notified them that the property contained wetlands subject to protection under the Clean Water Act and ordered them to remove the fill and restore the property to its natural state. Instead, the Sacketts sued the EPA, contending that the agency’s jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act does not extend to their property.\\n\\nThe central conflict of [Sackett v. EPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sackett_v._Environmental_Protection_Agency_\\(2012\\)) is whether a plurality decision by the Supreme Court in 2006 ([Rapanos v. United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapanos_v._United_States\\))) should be adopted to allow wetlands to be regulated only when they themselves have a continuous surface water connection to regulated waters. The EPA argues that wetlands separated from other waters of the United States by barriers are accurately defined as wetlands under protection of the Clean Water Act.\\n\\nReal life example: At least 20% of the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska is isolated wetlands. If the Supreme Court rules in favor of the Sacketts, this important and unique ecosystem will no longer be under federal protection.\\n\\nFurther reading: [Amicus brief](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/21/21-454/228197/20220616165114020_WOTUS%20Waterkeeper%20Amici%20FINAL.pdf) by Waterkeeper organizations. “Over one hundred environmental and community groups urge U.S. Supreme Court to uphold federal clean water protections,” [NRDC](https://www.nrdc.org/media/2022/220617).\\n\\n---\\n---\\n\\n#Voting rights\\n\\nOn the second day of the 2022-2023 term, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in [Merrill v. Milligan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrill_v._Milligan), a case that could further degrade the Voting Rights Act.\\n\\nMerrill v. Milligan originated from a challenge to Alabama’s 2020 redistricting cycle congressional map. A coalition of civil rights organizations and Alabama voters alleged that the plan is an unconstitutional racial gerrymander because race was the predominant consideration when creating numerous districts, and that the plan as a whole was enacted with the intent and the result of diluting African-American voting strength in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. \\n\\nIn February 2022, the Supreme Court [suspended](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/02/merrill-v-milligan-section-2-voting-rights-act-racial-redistricting-supreme-court.html) a lower court’s order to draw at least two districts “in which Black voters ... have an opportunity to elect a representative of their choice,” and scheduled oral arguments for the new term. Alabama asks the Court to invent a new test to determine if a map is racially gerrymandered—a test that, coincidentally, will be near impossible for voters and civil rights groups to satisfy. \\n\\n---\\n---\\n\\n#Death penalty\\n\\nThe Supreme Court already has a high-profile death penalty case on its schedule: [Reed v. Goertz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Reed), centering on Texas’ refusal to conduct DNA testing to confirm Reed’s guilt or clear his name.\\n\\nRodney Reed, a Black man, was convicted in 1998 for the abduction, rape, and murder of Stacey Stites, a white woman, by an all-white jury. The most damning evidence against Reed was DNA matching Reed collected from her body. However, Reed and Stites had a consensual sexual relationship at the time and he admits to having sex with her the day before her death. At the time of the trial, prosecutors allegedly [concealed](https://innocenceproject.org/for-23-years-prosecutors-illegally-hid-evidence-that-could-have-exonerated-rodney-reed/) statements from Stite’s co-workers that proved the pair were romantically involved.\\n\\n>At trial, prosecutors repeatedly told Mr. Reed’s jury — falsely — that investigators “talked to all these people, and not one of them … ever said she was associated with that defendant. Ever. They weren’t dating according to anyone, there weren’t friends, they weren’t associates.”…\\n\\n>On June 25, 2021, the State disclosed for the first time to Mr. Reed’s lawyers that Suzan Hugen, a friend and co-worker of Ms. Stites, gave a statement to police that she saw Mr. Reed and Ms. Stites at the H.E.B. where the women worked and she introduced Mr. Reed to Ms. Hugen as a “good or close friend.” Ms. Hugen told police that Ms. Stites and Mr. Reed appeared “friendly, giggling, and flirting.” …Two other H.E.B. co-workers of Ms. Stites also told police that Mr. Reed and Ms. Stites knew each other. These pre-trial interviews were not disclosed to Mr. Reed’s attorneys for 23 years,  until the eve of the July, 2021 evidentiary hearing.\\n\\nFurthermore, Jimmy Fennell, Stacey’s fiancé, was the prime suspect in the case. Friends and witnesses have since come forward and given testimony that Fennell provided inconsistent accounts of his whereabouts on the night of the murder and allegedly made threats on Stites’ life.\\n\\nReed’s execution has already been postponed numerous times, including once at the request of a bipartisan group of 16 Texas state senators. Reed is asking the Supreme Court to order DNA testing on the murder weapon, which has never been tested. \\n\\n---\\n---\\n\\n#Indian Child Welfare Act\\n\\nThe last scheduled case for the 2022-2023 term, so far, is [Haaland v. Brackeen](https://ballotpedia.org/Haaland_v._Brackeen). It is a complex case that could ultimately result in the Indian Child Welfare Act being declared unconstitutional.\\n\\nCongress passed the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) in 1978 to provide tribal governments with a voice in the removal and out-of-home placement of Native American children. Prior to the ICWA, many Native American children were forcibly taken away from their parents and extended relatives under the power of the federal government and placed in predominantly non-Native homes, which had no relation to Native American cultures. \\n\\nHaaland v. Brackeen involves numerous non-Native couples who wanted to adopt Native children but were opposed by the respective tribal governments. Texas, Louisiana, and Indiana joined the couples to ask the courts to declare the ICWA unconstitutional. District Court Judge Reed O’Connor, a George W. Bush appointee, ruled that the ICWA violated the non-delegation doctrine, the Tenth Amendment, and the Administrative Procedure Act. It was the first time a constitutional challenge to the ICWA had been successful.\\n\\nA three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed O’Connor’s ruling, but a subsequent en banc hearing [found](https://www.naag.org/attorney-general-journal/supreme-court-report-haaland-v-brackeen-21-376-cherokee-nation-v-brackeen-21-377-texas-v-haaland-21-378-brackeen-v-haaland-21-380/) that the ICWA’s adoptive placement and preference for an \"Indian foster home\" violates equal protection. \\n\\nFurther reading: [Briefs](https://icwa.narf.org/) from hundreds of governmental entities, child welfare organizations, and civil rights groups. “My family was torn apart before the Indian Child Welfare Act passed. Will SCOTUS upend it?” [Desert Sun](https://www.desertsun.com/story/opinion/contributors/valley-voice/2022/08/07/brackeen-v-haaland-supreme-court-may-overturn-indian-child-welfare-act/10240103002/) op-ed.\\n\\n---\\n---\\n\\n#Other cases\\n\\n[Arellano v. McDonough](https://ballotpedia.org/Arellano_v._McDonough): Whether the one-year filing deadline for veterans to submit disability claims after they are discharged can be extended for good cause. Adolfo Arellano developed post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental health conditions from his military service. 30 years later, he applied for disability benefits, which were approved by the VA and backdated to his 2011 filing date. Arellano contends that he was unable to file sooner due to his mental health conditions and asks the court to allow a more flexible time frame for veterans claims.\\n\\n[National Pork Producers Council v. Ross](https://ballotpedia.org/National_Pork_Producers_Council_v._Ross): Farmers and companies in the pork industry are challenging California’s Proposition 12, which prohibits the sale within the state of certain pork products that were produced using breeder pigs that were housed in a cruel manner. \\n\\n[Helix Energy Solutions Group, Inc. v. Hewitt](https://ballotpedia.org/Helix_Energy_Solutions_Group,_Inc._v._Hewitt): A supervisor on oil rigs for Helix Energy Solutions Group, Inc., who was paid a daily rate of at least $963 sued the company seeking overtime pay. The district court ruled he was exempt from overtime pay. On appeal, the 5th Circuit ruled that he was not exempt.\\n\\n[Axon Enterprise, Inc. v. Federal Trade Commission](https://ballotpedia.org/Axon_Enterprise,_Inc._v._Federal_Trade_Commission): A case to determine if federal courts have the authority to review constitutional challenges to the structure of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) without first going through administrative proceedings.\\n\\n[Students for Fair Admissions v.

President & Fellows of Harvard](https://ballotpedia.org/Students_for_Fair_Admissions,_Inc._v._President_%26_Fellows_of_Harvard): To determine whether colleges and universities can factor in students’ race and ethnicity in determining which students are admitted, a process known as affirmative action. \\n\\n[Jones v. Hendrix](https://ballotpedia.org/Jones_v._Hendrix): A man convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm (18 U.S.C. § 922) was denied relief even after the Supreme Court (in Rehaif v. United States (2019)) changed the requirements for a conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 922. He asks the Supreme Court to clarify that he is allowed to challenge his conviction under the Rehaif ruling.\\n\\n[Cruz v. Arizona](https://ballotpedia.org/Cruz_v._Arizona): John Cruz, convicted of murder, was prevented from telling the jury that he was not eligible for parole when they were considering whether to impose the death penalty. In 2016, the Supreme Court ruled that Arizona must allow defendants facing the death penalty to do so, but the Arizona Supreme Court has so far refused to grant Cruz post-conviction review.\\n\\n[Mallory v. Norfolk Southern Railway](https://ballotpedia.org/Mallory_v._Norfolk_Southern_Railway_Co.): A former employee of Norfolk Southern Railway Company sued, claiming that he had been exposed to toxic chemicals while working for the company. He filed the lawsuit against Norfolk Southern, a Virginia company, in Pennsylvania. The state dismissed the case because the claims in question do not arise out of or relate to Norfolk Southern’s conduct in Pennsylvania. The former employee argues that Norfolk Southern consented to personal jurisdiction in Pennsylvania by registering to do business there.\\n\\n[Health and Hospital Corporation of Marion County v. Talevski](https://ballotpedia.org/Health_and_Hospital_Corporation_of_Marion_County,_Indiana_v._Talevski): Whether third parties can initiate lawsuits against public institutions for violations of Congressional spending bills under claims of Section 1983, which was established to protect individual rights from constitutional violations from public institutions.\\n\\n---\\n---\\n\\n#Unscheduled cases\\n\\n[Moore v. Harper](https://ballotpedia.org/Moore_v._Harper): Whether state legislatures have ultimate power over election matters, e.g. the creation of redistricting maps that the state supreme court ruled illegally gerrymandered. Implicates the \"inde­pend­ent state legis­lature theory” and [could potentially](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/moore-v-harper-explained) allow state legislatures to override state courts and state constitutions on electoral rules and regulations.\\n\\n* Leonard Leo’s (of the Federalist Society) \"Honest Elections Project\" [filed](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/21/21-1271/237126/20220906144631896_21-1271%20tsac%20HEP%20Final.pdf) a Supreme Court brief arguing state legislatures are not constrained by even state constitutions protecting voting rights when they regulate federal elections. \\n\\n[303 Creative LLC v. Elenis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/303_Creative_LLC_v._Elenis): Challenge to Colorado’s anti-discrimination law (similar to Masterpiece Cakeshop).\\n\\n[Percoco v.

       "      <td>I'm sorry, but although I agree OJ was guilty, Chauvin's trial was as fair as anyone elses.  I watched alot of it and listened while at work and he was not slighted in his defense.  He may have been convicted in the public eye before the trial began, but that was because the video evidence was pretty hard to overcome.  How can he explain away his actions from that day?  There is no logical reason to manhandle someone that way who is not putting up a fight, and is begging to be allowed to breathe.\\n\\nI look at it like this.  A person in a position of power, whether a cop, president, or preacher, has a higher level of scrutiny and must live up to their position.  No one is perfect, but if you choose to be a preacher, then you have to try your best to live as God has instructed and when you slip, repent and ask forgiveness.  If you are president, then you \"should\" act with integrity and as a leader for your people.\\n\\nWhen a cop is tasked with keeping people safe and enforcing the laws we have created for society, it is extremely important for them to be the example for those who may choose the unlawful path.  Sometimes they are in situations that are life threatening, and are (or should be trained) to react in the amount of force necessary to end the conflict.  \\n\\nBut in today's advancement of technology, everything a person does can be caught under the public microscope.  Literally EVERYONE knows this ahead of time.  We know we are being watched from all angles, and should act accordingly.  It should be even more important for those who hold a higher position in our society than the lay folks.  So no, Derek Chauvin did not get mistreated in his trial.  He was represented by an attorney who used the law to his best ability to defend him, and he was convicted by a jury of peers.  He acted in a way that no peace officer should act.  If his actions, which we actually have full evidence of, are allowed to be swept away under the rug because he is a cop, then what can we expect from those who care nothing of the laws that shape our society?</td>\n",

English is not my native language.\\n\\nMy prediction is based on the most recent hearing; in which the judge reckommended Reed should not get a new trial, based on the above reasons among others.  As I've already said; the supreme court is looking over a procedural issue with regards to stature of limitations on DNA testing. Not the actual merits of the case. The Texas court of criminal appeals, is to my knowledge still looking the case over, and has a chance to ignore the recent reckomendation by judge Langley. They're proably a better bet for you than SCOTUS.\\n\\nIm's sorry, but your argument that you've looked over the case for 20 years, is less impressive, when you all but admitted that some of evidence of his guilt that I presented to you, was new information to you. I've been researching and keeping up with the case for 5 years and while there's certainly are limits to my knowledge,  it's not as comprehensively lacking as you seem to be infering, simply because I'm not from Bastrop. Almost everything on Reed's case, including trial transcripts and the lastest depostion by the defence are readily availible on the internet, so even if I havn't been to the courtroom, I have a pretty good idea exactly was was said in said courtroom. I'm curious: What do you have access to that I have not, over the internet? And more importantly, is that evidence something worth considering, if Reed's lwayers doesn't even seem to think so? Wouldn't they have in interest in presenting it to the public?\\n\\nI admire your optimism, but there's less than 0% chance of Reed walking free within 4 months. Unless you're talking about 2023, in which case there would at least be the  smallest of chances, depending on SCOTUS and court of criminal appeals, but at that point Reed stil has 4 pending indictments for sexual assualt hanging over his head.

He opposed Medicare for all, legalizing cannabis, advocated for hiring more police, and until a few months before a midterm that looked like it would go disastrously for Democrats, he opposed forgiving student loan debt. Advocating for reinforcing the status quo is a conservative position and that is what he ran on. \\n\\n&gt; If showing up doesn't matter, why does it work out for conservatives who show up?\\n\\nBecause this is a conservative country. It's why we have such an easy time moving right and never leftward. Look at how Democrats have spent the last 40 years playing catch up with the Republicans, trying to meet them in the middle. \\n\\n&gt; And 100%, stop calling Biden or Democrats conservatives just because capital generally exists.\\n\\nI don't think Democrats are conservatives because capital exists, I think they're conservatives because [capital actively supports them](https://americansfortaxfairness.org/billionaire-politics/), because [many of them are millionaires](https://rollcall.com/2018/03/02/every-member-of-congress-wealth-in-one-chart/), and because here in the Democrat dominated state of Washington, [a disproportionate amount of our legislators are landlords](https://www.thestranger.com/slog/2020/03/31/43291139/heres-how-many-landlords-there-are-in-the-washington-legislature#:~:text=So%2C%20at%20a%20minimum%2C%20there,19%20landlords%20in%20the%20legislature.).

You are putting those words in my mouth in response to a comment I made about how states/congressional districts have become less competitive, something that's [an empirical fact](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/gerrymandering-competitive-districts-near-extinction).\\n\\nVoting matters but it's not everything. People have been voting and it still got us to a point where access to abortion is threatened, far-right militias are growing, inequality is growing, and the wealthy have gained more and more influence over politics. It's time to stop pretending that voting for Democrats is the only solution. We keep doing it and things keep getting worse.\\n\\nPeople in the rest of the developed democracies did not get all the benefits as citizens they have from purely voting. They joined unions, they went on strike, they occasionally had to fight the police. They also had the ability to imagine that things could get better, something we in the supposedly dynamic and creative US seem to have lost the ability to do because the best we can seem to imagine is that the status quo will get better. It also helped their elites were terrified of a communist revolution where they'd be put up against a wall and shot. If you only and always play by the establishment's rules, it tells the establishment that it has nothing to fear from you and therefore has no incentive or reason to change.</td>\n",

Some people even think that I´m connected to the case in some way. Its pretty crazy, and entirely baseless. \\n\\nI fail to see how the fact that I used sources that PREDATES the lies told by the innocent project, is somehow a slight against my sources but not the innonce project themselves? They had the sources availible to them in 2019, yet chose to ignore it. As I also proved to you, many of their points are by now outdated, yet their 2019 website of \"facts\" still stands. \\n\\nI believe, that based on the evidence currenly availible to us Reed is guilty. 20+ years of post-litegation have contiuned to prove this. It is completely fine for you to come to a different conclusion. But this smells more like the backfire effect to me. We both want justice. Nobody wants an innocent man to get punished for something he didn´t do. You came into this with the theory of innocence, or at the very aleast reasonable doubt. I explained to you why that doubt can easily be seen as entirely reasonable, and you dug your heals further into the conspiratorial side of the case. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI will leave you with a single point showing that the innocence project are hypocrites. Linked are 3 seperate pages on the use of jailhouse informations in wrongfull conviction. I´m sure a deeper dive on their website would unearth even more. \\n\\n[https://innocenceproject.org/safeguarding-against-unreliable-jailhouse-informant-testimony/](https://innocenceproject.org/safeguarding-against-unreliable-jailhouse-informant-testimony/)\\n\\n[https://innocenceproject.org/informing-injustice/](https://innocenceproject.org/informing-injustice/)\\n\\n[https://innocenceproject.org/nebraska-bill-jailhouse-informants/](https://innocenceproject.org/nebraska-bill-jailhouse-informants/) \\n\\nWhy is this important? Well it is important because in the 10 \"facts\" about Reed on that very same website, The innocence project put such great emphasis on the fact the Fennell had confessed while in jail another inmate. Why is using jail house informants only deplorable when the states uses them? But totally a-ok when it benefits the Innocence project?

I watched alot of it and listened while at work and he was not slighted in his defense.  He may have been convicted in the public eye before the trial began, but that was because the video evidence was pretty hard to overcome.  How can he explain away his actions from that day?  There is no logical reason to manhandle someone that way who is not putting up a fight, and is begging to be allowed to breathe.\\n\\nI look at it like this.  A person in a position of power, whether a cop, president, or preacher, has a higher level of scrutiny and must live up to their position.  No one is perfect, but if you choose to be a preacher, then you have to try your best to live as God has instructed and when you slip, repent and ask forgiveness.  If you are president, then you \"should\" act with integrity and as a leader for your people.\\n\\nWhen a cop is tasked with keeping people safe and enforcing the laws we have created for society, it is extremely important for them to be the example for those who may choose the unlawful path.  Sometimes they are in situations that are life threatening, and are (or should be trained) to react in the amount of force necessary to end the conflict.  \\n\\nBut in today's advancement of technology, everything a person does can be caught under the public microscope.  Literally EVERYONE knows this ahead of time.  We know we are being watched from all angles, and should act accordingly.  It should be even more important for those who hold a higher position in our society than the lay folks.  So no, Derek Chauvin did not get mistreated in his trial.  He was represented by an attorney who used the law to his best ability to defend him, and he was convicted by a jury of peers.  He acted in a way that no peace officer should act.  If his actions, which we actually have full evidence of, are allowed to be swept away under the rug because he is a cop, then what can we expect from those who care nothing of the laws that shape our society?   \n",

English is not my native language.\\n\\nMy prediction is based on the most recent hearing; in which the judge reckommended Reed should not get a new trial, based on the above reasons among others.  As I've already said; the supreme court is looking over a procedural issue with regards to stature of limitations on DNA testing. Not the actual merits of the case. The Texas court of criminal appeals, is to my knowledge still looking the case over, and has a chance to ignore the recent reckomendation by judge Langley. They're proably a better bet for you than SCOTUS.\\n\\nIm's sorry, but your argument that you've looked over the case for 20 years, is less impressive, when you all but admitted that some of evidence of his guilt that I presented to you, was new information to you. I've been researching and keeping up with the case for 5 years and while there's certainly are limits to my knowledge,  it's not as comprehensively lacking as you seem to be infering, simply because I'm not from Bastrop. Almost everything on Reed's case, including trial transcripts and the lastest depostion by the defence are readily availible on the internet, so even if I havn't been to the courtroom, I have a pretty good idea exactly was was said in said courtroom. I'm curious: What do you have access to that I have not, over the internet? And more importantly, is that evidence something worth considering, if Reed's lwayers doesn't even seem to think so? Wouldn't they have in interest in presenting it to the public?\\n\\nI admire your optimism, but there's less than 0% chance of Reed walking free within 4 months. Unless you're talking about 2023, in which case there would at least be the  smallest of chances, depending on SCOTUS and court of criminal appeals, but at that point Reed stil has 4 pending indictments for sexual assualt hanging over his head.

       "863   > Biden never ran as a conservative, what are you even talking about?\\n\\nJoe Biden in 2019: [\"At a high-level fundraising event in New York Tuesday night, 2020 Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden said he wouldn't want to 'demonize' the wealthy and that 'no one's standard of living will change' if he's elected, according to a pool report.\"](https://www.axios.com/2019/06/19/joe-biden-wealthy-donors-demonize)\\n\\nHe also emphasized his supposed ability to turn back the clock to the 80s by getting Republicans to support bipartisanship. He opposed Medicare for all, legalizing cannabis, advocated for hiring more police, and until a few months before a midterm that looked like it would go disastrously for Democrats, he opposed forgiving student loan debt. Advocating for reinforcing the status quo is a conservative position and that is what he ran on. \\n\\n> If showing up doesn't matter, why does it work out for conservatives who show up?\\n\\nBecause this is a conservative country. It's why we have such an easy time moving right and never leftward. Look at how Democrats have spent the last 40 years playing catch up with the Republicans, trying to meet them in the middle. \\n\\n> And 100%, stop calling Biden or Democrats conservatives just because capital generally exists.\\n\\nI don't think Democrats are conservatives because capital exists, I think they're conservatives because [capital actively supports them](https://americansfortaxfairness.org/billionaire-politics/), because [many of them are millionaires](https://rollcall.com/2018/03/02/every-member-of-congress-wealth-in-one-chart/), and because here in the Democrat dominated state of Washington, [a disproportionate amount of our legislators are landlords](https://www.thestranger.com/slog/2020/03/31/43291139/heres-how-many-landlords-there-are-in-the-washington-legislature#:~:text=So%2C%20at%20a%20minimum%2C%20there,19%20landlords%20in%20the%20legislature.). This is [true of the federal Congress as well](https://www.businessinsider.com/congress-assets-property-real-estate-law-2021-12).\\n\\n> Nothing will change if people throw their hands up in the air and decide that participating is pointless.\\n\\nI never said that. You are putting those words in my mouth in response to a comment I made about how states/congressional districts have become less competitive, something that's [an empirical fact](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/gerrymandering-competitive-districts-near-extinction).\\n\\nVoting matters but it's not everything. People have been voting and it still got us to a point where access to abortion is threatened, far-right militias are growing, inequality is growing, and the wealthy have gained more and more influence over politics. It's time to stop pretending that voting for Democrats is the only solution. We keep doing it and things keep getting worse.\\n\\nPeople in the rest of the developed democracies did not get all the benefits as citizens they have from purely voting. They joined unions, they went on strike, they occasionally had to fight the police. They also had the ability to imagine that things could get better, something we in the supposedly dynamic and creative US seem to have lost the ability to do because the best we can seem to imagine is that the status quo will get better. It also helped their elites were terrified of a communist revolution where they'd be put up against a wall and shot. If you only and always play by the establishment's rules, it tells the establishment that it has nothing to fear from you and therefore has no incentive or reason to change.   \n",

I see how you might come to that conclusion, seing as you seem to have a very conspiratorial mind. This is not unusual when debating this case. Some people even think that I´m connected to the case in some way. Its pretty crazy, and entirely baseless. \\n\\nI fail to see how the fact that I used sources that PREDATES the lies told by the innocent project, is somehow a slight against my sources but not the innonce project themselves? They had the sources availible to them in 2019, yet chose to ignore it. As I also proved to you, many of their points are by now outdated, yet their 2019 website of \"facts\" still stands. \\n\\nI believe, that based on the evidence currenly availible to us Reed is guilty. 20+ years of post-litegation have contiuned to prove this. It is completely fine for you to come to a different conclusion. But this smells more like the backfire effect to me. We both want justice. Nobody wants an innocent man to get punished for something he didn´t do. You came into this with the theory of innocence, or at the very aleast reasonable doubt. I explained to you why that doubt can easily be seen as entirely reasonable, and you dug your heals further into the conspiratorial side of the case. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI will leave you with a single point showing that the innocence project are hypocrites. Linked are 3 seperate pages on the use of jailhouse informations in wrongfull conviction. I´m sure a deeper dive on their website would unearth even more. \\n\\n[https://innocenceproject.org/safeguarding-against-unreliable-jailhouse-informant-testimony/](https://innocenceproject.org/safeguarding-against-unreliable-jailhouse-informant-testimony/)\\n\\n[https://innocenceproject.org/informing-injustice/](https://innocenceproject.org/informing-injustice/)\\n\\n[https://innocenceproject.org/nebraska-bill-jailhouse-informants/](https://innocenceproject.org/nebraska-bill-jailhouse-informants/) \\n\\nWhy is this important? Well it is important because in the 10 \"facts\" about Reed on that very same website, The innocence project put such great emphasis on the fact the Fennell had confessed while in jail another inmate. Why is using jail house informants only deplorable when the states uses them? But totally a-ok when it benefits the Innocence project? Here I would again like to stress, that this star witness starting pleading the 5th during cross, pointing to that maybe he wasn´t that good of a witness to begin with.   \n",

As to Dr. Bayardo’s “recantation,” two federal courts have disagreed with Reed’s word choice, finding little difference between his trial testimony and affidavit. As to Reed’s new time of death estimate, opining that Stites died earlier than estimated, it is curious given that Reed has tried to push back Stites’s time of death through supposedly reliable eyewitnesses, and he has offered other expert testimony that no reliable time of death could be estimated in this case. **In other words, as soon as a court debunks one theory of innocence, he simply offers another.**\\n\\n&gt; **As to Fennell, whatever might be said about him, it pales in comparison with Reed’s history of violent sexual assault, assaults sharing many similarities with Stites’s murder—many victims were Stites’s age or very near; many were abused in Bastrop; a couple were raped or abducted close in time to Stite's murder; many were subjected to anal or attempted anal rape; and all but one were subjected to physical violence in addition to rape or attempted rape. Ultimately, Reed must have a compelling reason for why his semen was inside a murdered woman.** \\n\\nHis case hinges on the fact that he had a consensual relationship with Stacey.  Because if he didn't, he is guilty.  And, for Reed to be innocent, he would have had to have had anal and vaginal sex with Stacey **two days** (his own admission) prior to her murder, and then have her be murdered by someone else (Fennell or someone unknown) who staged a rape to throw off the investigation.  This murderer was also lucky enough to kill a woman who did not shower or bath for two days.  And he would also have to explain why he denied ever knowing Stacey Stites until confronted with the fact that his semen was found on and inside of her.  \\n\\nAnd let's not forget that it wasn't just Stacey Stites.\\n\\n&gt; **The rape and murder of Stites was hardly Reed’s first or last foray against women.** First was Connie York, a nineteen-year-old who had come home late one evening after swimming with friends. York was grabbed from behind and told “don’t scream or I’ll hurt you.”  When York did not listen, she was repeatedly struck, dragged to her bedroom, and raped multiple times. Reed was interviewed, and, while he admitted that he knew York from high school, he denied raping her. **When confronted with a search warrant for biological samples, Reed had an about-face, “Yeah, I had sex with her, she wanted it.”**\\n\\n&gt; Next was A.W., **a twelve-year-old girl**, who was home alone, having fallen asleep on a couch after watching TV. A.W. awoke when someone began pushing her face into the couch and had blindfolded and gagged her. **She was repeatedly hit in the head, called vulgar names, and orally, vaginally, and anally raped. The foreign DNA from A.W.’s rape kit was compared to Reed; Reed was not excluded and only one in 5.5 billion people would have the same foreign DNA profile from A.W.’s rape kit.**\\n\\n&gt; Then came Lucy Eipper, who Reed had met in high school, and whom Reed began to date after her graduation. Eipper had two children with Reed. **Throughout their relationship, Reed physically abused Eipper, including while she was pregnant, and raped her “all the time,” including one time in front of their two children.**\\n\\n&gt; Afterwards, Reed began dating Caroline Rivas, **an intellectually disabled woman**. Rivas’s caseworker noticed bruises on Rivas’s body and, when asked about them, Rivas admitted that Reed would hurt her if she would not have sex with him. **Later, Rivas’s caseworker noticed that Rivas was walking oddly and sat down gingerly. Rivas admitted that Reed had, the prior evening, hit her, called her vulgar names, and anally raped her. The samples from Rivas’s rape kit provided the link to Stites’s murder.**\\n\\n&gt; **Shortly thereafter, and about six months before Stites’s murder, Reed raped Vivian Harbottle underneath a train trestle as she was walking home. When she pleaded for her life for the sake of her children, Reed laughed at her. The foreign DNA from Harbottle’s rape kit was compared to Reed; he could not be excluded, and only one person in 5.5 billion would be expected to have the same foreign DNA profile.**\\n\\n&gt; Finally, and about six months after Stites’s murder, Reed convinced nineteen-year-old Linda Schlueter to give him a ride home at about 3:30 a.m. **Reed led her to a remote area and then attacked her. After a prolonged struggle, Schlueter asked Reed what he wanted and Reed responded, “I want a blow job.” When Schlueter told Reed that “you will have to kill me before you get anything,” Reed stated “I guess I’ll have to kill you then.” Before Schlueter could be raped, a car drove by and Reed fled.**\\n\\nKind of odd that Kim Kardashian and the Innocence Project forget to mention all of that.\\n\\nFeel free to learn the [truth](https://rodneyreedfulltruth.com/) about this case.</td>\n",

But today, new witnesses including Stacey’s own cousin and co-worker have corroborated Rodney’s claim that they knew that he and Stacey were romantically involved.\\nRenowned forensic pathologists have concluded that Rodney’s guilt is medically and scientifically impossible. The prosecution’s only forensic evidence linking Rodney to the crime was semen taken from Stacey’s body, which was attributed to the consensual relationship between them. The prosecution used this to connect him to the murder and refute their consensual romantic relationship, but the testimony supporting this theory has since been recanted, completely discrediting the State’s case.\\nFor months after the murder, Jimmy Fennell, Stacey’s fiancé, was the prime suspect in the case.

When asked to explain this discrepancy, Jimmy declined to testify because his answers might further incriminate him.\\nTwo witnesses have recently come forward and submitted signed affidavits that add to the mounting evidence against Jimmy Fennell. These affidavits include testimony from an insurance salesperson who stated that Jimmy threatened to kill Stacey while applying for life insurance.

The CCA has done\\nso on multiple occasions. Moreover, Reed’s newest theory of innocence, including the supposed retraction from Dr. Bayardo and the opinions of Drs. Baden and Spitz, has also been found insufficient. Reed has been given the opportunity to be heard on his actual innocence “claim,” but he has simply failed to prove it. There is nothing fundamentally unfair in the repeated, in-depth review Reed has been afforded of his actual innocence \"claim.\"\\n\\n> Moreover, the State disagrees with the factual basis for Reed’s actual innocence “claim”, and it is Reed’s unspoken reason for a writ of certiorari. As to Dr. Bayardo’s “recantation,” two federal courts have disagreed with Reed’s word choice, finding little difference between his trial testimony and affidavit. As to Reed’s new time of death estimate, opining that Stites died earlier than estimated, it is curious given that Reed has tried to push back Stites’s time of death through supposedly reliable eyewitnesses, and he has offered other expert testimony that no reliable time of death could be estimated in this case. **In other words, as soon as a court debunks one theory of innocence, he simply offers another.**\\n\\n> **As to Fennell, whatever might be said about him, it pales in comparison with Reed’s history of violent sexual assault, assaults sharing many similarities with Stites’s murder—many victims were Stites’s age or very near; many were abused in Bastrop; a couple were raped or abducted close in time to Stite's murder; many were subjected to anal or attempted anal rape; and all but one were subjected to physical violence in addition to rape or attempted rape. Ultimately, Reed must have a compelling reason for why his semen was inside a murdered woman.** \\n\\nHis case hinges on the fact that he had a consensual relationship with Stacey.  Because if he didn't, he is guilty.  And, for Reed to be innocent, he would have had to have had anal and vaginal sex with Stacey **two days** (his own admission) prior to her murder, and then have her be murdered by someone else (Fennell or someone unknown) who staged a rape to throw off the investigation.  This murderer was also lucky enough to kill a woman who did not shower or bath for two days.  And he would also have to explain why he denied ever knowing Stacey Stites until confronted with the fact that his semen was found on and inside of her.  \\n\\nAnd let's not forget that it wasn't just Stacey Stites.\\n\\n> **The rape and murder of Stites was hardly Reed’s first or last foray against women.** First was Connie York, a nineteen-year-old who had come home late one evening after swimming with friends. York was grabbed from behind and told “don’t scream or I’ll hurt you.”  When York did not listen, she was repeatedly struck, dragged to her bedroom, and raped multiple times. Reed was interviewed, and, while he admitted that he knew York from high school, he denied raping her. **When confronted with a search warrant for biological samples, Reed had an about-face, “Yeah, I had sex with her, she wanted it.”**\\n\\n> Next was A.W., **a twelve-year-old girl**, who was home alone, having fallen asleep on a couch after watching TV. A.W. awoke when someone began pushing her face into the couch and had blindfolded and gagged her. **She was repeatedly hit in the head, called vulgar names, and orally, vaginally, and anally raped. The foreign DNA from A.W.’s rape kit was compared to Reed; Reed was not excluded and only one in 5.5 billion people would have the same foreign DNA profile from A.W.’s rape kit.**\\n\\n> Then came Lucy Eipper, who Reed had met in high school, and whom Reed began to date after her graduation. Eipper had two children with Reed. **Throughout their relationship, Reed physically abused Eipper, including while she was pregnant, and raped her “all the time,” including one time in front of their two children.**\\n\\n> Afterwards, Reed began dating Caroline Rivas, **an intellectually disabled woman**. Rivas’s caseworker noticed bruises on Rivas’s body and, when asked about them, Rivas admitted that Reed would hurt her if she would not have sex with him. **Later, Rivas’s caseworker noticed that Rivas was walking oddly and sat down gingerly. Rivas admitted that Reed had, the prior evening, hit her, called her vulgar names, and anally raped her. The samples from Rivas’s rape kit provided the link to Stites’s murder.**\\n\\n> **Shortly thereafter, and about six months before Stites’s murder, Reed raped Vivian Harbottle underneath a train trestle as she was walking home. When she pleaded for her life for the sake of her children, Reed laughed at her. The foreign DNA from Harbottle’s rape kit was compared to Reed; he could not be excluded, and only one person in 5.5 billion would be expected to have the same foreign DNA profile.**\\n\\n> Finally, and about six months after Stites’s murder, Reed convinced nineteen-year-old Linda Schlueter to give him a ride home at about 3:30 a.m. **Reed led her to a remote area and then attacked her. After a prolonged struggle, Schlueter asked Reed what he wanted and Reed responded, “I want a blow job.” When Schlueter told Reed that “you will have to kill me before you get anything,” Reed stated “I guess I’ll have to kill you then.” Before Schlueter could be raped, a car drove by and Reed fled.**\\n\\nKind of odd that Kim Kardashian and the Innocence Project forget to mention all of that.\\n\\nFeel free to learn the [truth](https://rodneyreedfulltruth.com/) about this case.   \n",

And he would also have to explain why he denied ever knowing Stacey Stites until confronted with the fact that his semen was found on and inside of her.  \\n\\nAnd let's not forget that it wasn't just Stacey Stites.\\n\\n> **The rape and murder of Stites was hardly Reed’s first or last foray against women.** First was Connie York, a nineteen-year-old who had come home late one evening after swimming with friends. York was grabbed from behind and told “don’t scream or I’ll hurt you.”  When York did not listen, she was repeatedly struck, dragged to her bedroom, and raped multiple times. Reed was interviewed, and, while he admitted that he knew York from high school, he denied raping her. **When confronted with a search warrant for biological samples, Reed had an about-face, “Yeah, I had sex with her, she wanted it.”**\\n\\n> Next was A.W., **a twelve-year-old girl**, who was home alone, having fallen asleep on a couch after watching TV. A.W. awoke when someone began pushing her face into the couch and had blindfolded and gagged her. **She was repeatedly hit in the head, called vulgar names, and orally, vaginally, and anally raped. The foreign DNA from A.W.’s rape kit was compared to Reed; Reed was not excluded and only one in 5.5 billion people would have the same foreign DNA profile from A.W.’s rape kit.**\\n\\n> Then came Lucy Eipper, who Reed had met in high school, and whom Reed began to date after her graduation. Eipper had two children with Reed. **Throughout their relationship, Reed physically abused Eipper, including while she was pregnant, and raped her “all the time,” including one time in front of their two children.**\\n\\n> Afterwards, Reed began dating Caroline Rivas, **an intellectually disabled woman**. Rivas’s caseworker noticed bruises on Rivas’s body and, when asked about them, Rivas admitted that Reed would hurt her if she would not have sex with him. **Later, Rivas’s caseworker noticed that Rivas was walking oddly and sat down gingerly. Rivas admitted that Reed had, the prior evening, hit her, called her vulgar names, and anally raped her. The samples from Rivas’s rape kit provided the link to Stites’s murder.**\\n\\n> **Shortly thereafter, and about six months before Stites’s murder, Reed raped Vivian Harbottle underneath a train trestle as she was walking home. When she pleaded for her life for the sake of her children, Reed laughed at her. The foreign DNA from Harbottle’s rape kit was compared to Reed; he could not be excluded, and only one person in 5.5 billion would be expected to have the same foreign DNA profile.**\\n\\n> Finally, and about six months after Stites’s murder, Reed convinced nineteen-year-old Linda Schlueter to give him a ride home at about 3:30 a.m. **Reed led her to a remote area and then attacked her. After a prolonged struggle, Schlueter asked Reed what he wanted and Reed responded, “I want a blow job.” When Schlueter told Reed that “you will have to kill me before you get anything,” Reed stated “I guess I’ll have to kill you then.” Before Schlueter could be raped, a car drove by and Reed fled.**\\n\\nKind of odd that Kim Kardashian and the Innocence Project forget to mention all of that.\\n\\nFeel free to learn the [truth](https://rodneyreedfulltruth.com/) about this case.   https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/k9zbbe/kim_kardashian_and_other_celebs_believe_rodney/gfaogsl /u/DJHJR86   \n",

but this shit is insane;\\nThe murder weapon has never been tested for DNA evidence. Requests for DNA testing of crime scene evidence, including of a belt that was used as the murder weapon, have been repeatedly denied by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. And the United States Supreme Court declined to directly review the Texas courts’ denial of DNA testing in 2018.\\nThe State’s forensic experts have admitted to errors in their testimonies, which led to Rodney’s conviction and death sentence.\\n State witnesses from Rodney’s original trial have since submitted affidavits stating that testimony given related to Stacey’s time of death was inaccurate, making the prosecution’s timeline of Rodney allegedly killing her implausible.\\nRodney Reed and Stacey Stites were having a consensual sexual relationship. At the time of the trial, no one came forward to corroborate their relationship. But today, new witnesses including Stacey’s own cousin and co-worker have corroborated Rodney’s claim that they knew that he and Stacey were romantically involved.\\nRenowned forensic pathologists have concluded that Rodney’s guilt is medically and scientifically impossible. The prosecution’s only forensic evidence linking Rodney to the crime was semen taken from Stacey’s body, which was attributed to the consensual relationship between them. The prosecution used this to connect him to the murder and refute their consensual romantic relationship, but the testimony supporting this theory has since been recanted, completely discrediting the State’s case.\\nFor months after the murder, Jimmy Fennell, Stacey’s fiancé, was the prime suspect in the case. A recording of one of the police investigators indicates that Jimmy was suspected in Stacey’s murder, and he was believed to be motivated by her relationship with another man.\\nJimmy’s best friend at the time of the crime, Bastrop Sheriff’s Officer Curtis Davis, has now revealed that Jimmy gave an inconsistent account of where he was on the night of the murder. Jimmy had told his friend he was out drinking on the night Stacey was murdered. But he later stated he was with Stacey in the apartment they shared during what we now know was the actual time of her death, based on Dr. Michael Baden’s updated testimony, which contradicts his initial claim. When asked to explain this discrepancy, Jimmy declined to testify because his answers might further incriminate him.\\nTwo witnesses have recently come forward and submitted signed affidavits that add to the mounting evidence against Jimmy Fennell. These affidavits include testimony from an insurance salesperson who stated that Jimmy threatened to kill Stacey while applying for life insurance. The second witness was a Deputy in the Lee County Sheriff’s Office at the time of the murder to whom Jimmy made an alarming and incriminating statement regarding Stacey’s body at her funeral.\\nJimmy later served a 10-year prison term for a sex crime and kidnapping he committed while on duty. Law enforcement records also document a pattern of violence against women perpetrated by Jimmy.\\nThis case was racially charged. Rodney, a Black man, was found guilty of murdering Stacey, a white woman, by an all-white jury.\\nA confession by Jimmy Fennell has come to light. On Oct. 29, 2019 Arthur Snow, a former member of the Aryan Brotherhood and Jimmy’s prison mate, disclosed that Jimmy had confessed to murdering Stacey stating, “I had to kill my n*****-loving fiancée,” in a conversation.   \n",

murder weapon has never been tested for DNA evidence. \\n\\n* Requests for DNA testing of crime scene evidence, including of a belt that was used as the murder weapon, have been repeatedly denied by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals and the United States Supreme Court declined to directly review the Texas courts’ denial of DNA testing in 2018. \\n\\n* The State’s forensic experts have admitted to errors in their testimonies, which led to Rodney’s conviction and death sentence.\\n\\n* State witnesses from Rodney’s original trial have since submitted affidavits stating that testimony given related to Stacey’s time of death was inaccurate, making the prosecution’s timeline of Rodney allegedly killing her implausible.\\n*  Rodney Reed and Stacey Stites were having a consensual sexual relationship. At the time of the trial, no one came forward to corroborate their relationship. But today, new witnesses including Stacey’s own cousin and co-worker have corroborated Rodney’s claim that they knew that he and Stacey were romantically involved. \\n* Renowned forensic pathologists have concluded that Rodney’s guilt is medically and scientifically impossible. The prosecution’s only forensic evidence linking Rodney to the crime was semen taken from Stacey’s body, which was attributed to the consensual relationship between them. The prosecution used this to connect him to the murder and refute their consensual romantic relationship, but the testimony supporting this theory has since been recanted, completely discrediting the State’s case. \\n* For months after the murder, Jimmy Fennell, Stacey’s fiancé, was the prime suspect in the case. A recording of one of the police investigators indicates that Jimmy was suspected in Stacey’s murder, and he was believed to be motivated by her relationship with another man. Jimmy’s best friend at the time of the crime, Bastrop Sheriff’s Officer Curtis Davis, has now revealed that Jimmy gave an inconsistent account of where he was on the night of the murder. Jimmy had told his friend he was out drinking on the night Stacey was murdered. But he later stated he was with Stacey in the apartment they shared during what we now know was the actual time of her death, based on Dr. Michael Baden’s updated testimony, which contradicts his initial claim. When asked to explain this discrepancy, Jimmy declined to testify because his answers might further incriminate him. \\n* Two witnesses have recently come forward and submitted signed affidavits that add to the mounting evidence against Jimmy Fennell. These affidavits include testimony from an insurance salesperson who stated that Jimmy threatened to kill Stacey while applying for life insurance. The second witness was a Deputy in the Lee County Sheriff’s Office at the time of the murder to whom Jimmy made an alarming and incriminating statement regarding Stacey’s body at her funeral. Jimmy later served a 10-year prison term for a sex crime and kidnapping he committed while on duty. Law enforcement records also document a pattern of violence against women perpetrated by Jimmy.\\n*  This case was racially charged. Rodney, a Black man, was found guilty of murdering Stacey, a white woman, by an all-white jury. \\n* A confession by Jimmy Fennell has come to light. On Oct. 29, 2019 Arthur Snow, a former member of the Aryan Brotherhood and Jimmy’s prison mate, disclosed that Jimmy had confessed to murdering Stacey stating, “I had to kill my n*****-loving fiancée,” in a conversation.   \n",
