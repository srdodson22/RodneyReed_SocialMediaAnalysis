While this is a bit different from what you normally cover (as it is happening CURRENTLY!) it has all the things you love: Dr Phil (for Stu) covered this in 2019 and county corruption to its core. A potentially INNOCENT MAN has been sitting not just in prison, but on TEXAS DEATH ROW for damn near 30 years! This means a potentially innocent man has been locked in a cell block for 23 hours a day for over 25 years. This is not just a suggestion, but a MUST COVER as Rodney’s execution was postponed because of the coverage from Dr Phil. Yet, he is still there! Still on death row!

1e53ea4,SCOTUS Grants Stay of Execution for Ruben Gutierrez ,"https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/071624zr1_4315.pdf

For the first time since 2021 the Supreme Court has granted a stay of execution. Attached below is the petition for cert for Ruben Gutierrez. That’s pretty incredible. 


https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-7809/315731/20240625164131272_24-06-25_CertPetition.pdf

From the cert petition:
 
*""In Reed v. Goertz, 598 U.S. 230, 234 (2023), this Court held that Rodney Reed has standing to pursue a declaratory judgment that Texas’s post-conviction DNA statute was unconstitutional because “Reed suffered an injury in fact,” the named defendant “caused Reed’s injury,” and if a federal court concludes that Texas’s statute violates due process, it is “substantially likely that the state prosecutor would abide by such a court order.”* 

*In this case, a divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit refused to follow that ruling over a dissent that recognized that this case was indistinguishable from Reed. The majority formulated its own novel test for Article III standing, which requires scouring the record of the parties’ dispute and any legal
arguments asserted, to predict whether the defendants in a particular case would actually redress the plaintiff’s injury by complying with a federal court’s declaratory judgment. Gutierrez v. Saenz, 93 F.4th 267, 274 (5th Cir. 2024).*

*The Fifth Circuit’s new test conflicts with Reed and creates a circuit split with the United States Courts of Appeals for the Eighth and Ninth Circuits, which have applied the standing doctrine exactly as this Court directed in Reed. See Johnson v. Griffin, 69 F.4th 506 (8th Cir. 2023); Redd v. Guerrero, 84 F.4th 874 (9th Cir. 2023).* 

*The question presented is: Does Article III standing require a particularized determination of whether a specific state official will redress the plaintiff’s injury by following a favorable declaratory judgment?""*


From what I understand Gutierrez is saying the 5th circuit is ignoring Reed v Goertz and that he does actually have standing. I’ll get the Reed holding here in just a minute as well but it’s was 6-3 ruling written by Kavanaugh (Roberts, Sotomayor, Kagan, Barrett, Jackson join) from the 22-23 term. 



**Reed v Goertz (2023)**

*Held: When a prisoner pursues state post-conviction DNA testing through the state-provided litigation process, the statute of limitations for a §1983 procedural due process claim begins to run when the state litigation ends, in this case when the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals denied Reed’s motion for rehearing.

1d1hmte,AJ A. / Corruption,"1) Don’t live in Texas (unless you were born there, I suppose). 

2) The police, and therefore the prosecutors, decided immediately who was guilty. (And are almost certainly hiding who knows how much evidence.)

3) Josh who? How is this not in the forefront and more focus places on him and his psychological issues?  

4) After THREE trials, and slowly, so slowly, uncovering new evidence through each trial. Who knows what’s still under wraps from the police/prosecution?  Clearly much more, with the request for appeal. 

5) Fired DNA analyst?!  What?!

6) As always, corrupt police, and prosecutors who grab onto all the goods, BS included, get away with no consequences personally, and always at others’ expense. Especially others who don’t have access and/or can’t afford decent representation.

7) NEW REPRESENTATION! (Three strikes, come on.)

I’m almost 62. My life’s biggest regret is not becoming a criminal defense attorney, and be one of the amazing attorneys (Innocence Project) who represent those most in need. I got to JD but criminal defense was my heart. 

8) I’m praying for, but sadly, not counting on, an appeal. *see fired DNA; Josh

*Also, please look up Rodney Reed. His death row sentence is the epitome of police corruption (especially when the fiancée of the victim is a cop). Again, stay out of Texas.

#Clean Water Act

The 2022-2023 Supreme Court term begins next month with a case that could gut the Clean Water Act and, at the very least, remove wetlands from federal protection.

The case revolves around the Sackett family, who began building a house on their Idaho land over 15 years ago. Shortly after the Sacketts filled the lot with sand and gravel, the EPA notified them that the property contained wetlands subject to protection under the Clean Water Act and ordered them to remove the fill and restore the property to its natural state. Instead, the Sacketts sued the EPA, contending that the agency’s jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act does not extend to their property.

The central conflict of [Sackett v. EPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sackett_v._Environmental_Protection_Agency_\(2012\)) is whether a plurality decision by the Supreme Court in 2006 ([Rapanos v. United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapanos_v._United_States\))) should be adopted to allow wetlands to be regulated only when they themselves have a continuous surface water connection to regulated waters. The EPA argues that wetlands separated from other waters of the United States by barriers are accurately defined as wetlands under protection of the Clean Water Act.

Real life example: At least 20% of the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska is isolated wetlands. If the Supreme Court rules in favor of the Sacketts, this important and unique ecosystem will no longer be under federal protection.

#Voting rights

On the second day of the 2022-2023 term, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in [Merrill v. Milligan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrill_v._Milligan), a case that could further degrade the Voting Rights Act.

Merrill v. Milligan originated from a challenge to Alabama’s 2020 redistricting cycle congressional map. A coalition of civil rights organizations and Alabama voters alleged that the plan is an unconstitutional racial gerrymander because race was the predominant consideration when creating numerous districts, and that the plan as a whole was enacted with the intent and the result of diluting African-American voting strength in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. 

In February 2022, the Supreme Court [suspended](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/02/merrill-v-milligan-section-2-voting-rights-act-racial-redistricting-supreme-court.html) a lower court’s order to draw at least two districts “in which Black voters ... have an opportunity to elect a representative of their choice,” and scheduled oral arguments for the new term. Alabama asks the Court to invent a new test to determine if a map is racially gerrymandered—a test that, coincidentally, will be near impossible for voters and civil rights groups to satisfy.

#Death penalty

The Supreme Court already has a high-profile death penalty case on its schedule: [Reed v. Goertz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Reed), centering on Texas’ refusal to conduct DNA testing to confirm Reed’s guilt or clear his name.

Rodney Reed, a Black man, was convicted in 1998 for the abduction, rape, and murder of Stacey Stites, a white woman, by an all-white jury. The most damning evidence against Reed was DNA matching Reed collected from her body. However, Reed and Stites had a consensual sexual relationship at the time and he admits to having sex with her the day before her death. At the time of the trial, prosecutors allegedly [concealed](https://innocenceproject.org/for-23-years-prosecutors-illegally-hid-evidence-that-could-have-exonerated-rodney-reed/) statements from Stite’s co-workers that proved the pair were romantically involved.

>At trial, prosecutors repeatedly told Mr. Reed’s jury — falsely — that investigators “talked to all these people, and not one of them … ever said she was associated with that defendant. Ever. They weren’t dating according to anyone, there weren’t friends, they weren’t associates.”…

>On June 25, 2021, the State disclosed for the first time to Mr. Reed’s lawyers that Suzan Hugen, a friend and co-worker of Ms. Stites, gave a statement to police that she saw Mr. Reed and Ms. Stites at the H.E.B. where the women worked and she introduced Mr. Reed to Ms. Hugen as a “good or close friend.” Ms. Hugen told police that Ms. Stites and Mr. Reed appeared “friendly, giggling, and flirting.” …Two other H.E.B. co-workers of Ms. Stites also told police that Mr. Reed and Ms. Stites knew each other. These pre-trial interviews were not disclosed to Mr. Reed’s attorneys for 23 years,  until the eve of the July, 2021 evidentiary hearing.

Furthermore, Jimmy Fennell, Stacey’s fiancé, was the prime suspect in the case. Friends and witnesses have since come forward and given testimony that Fennell provided inconsistent accounts of his whereabouts on the night of the murder and allegedly made threats on Stites’ life.

Reed’s execution has already been postponed numerous times, including once at the request of a bipartisan group of 16 Texas state senators. Reed is asking the Supreme Court to order DNA testing on the murder weapon, which has never been tested.

#Indian Child Welfare Act

The last scheduled case for the 2022-2023 term, so far, is [Haaland v. Brackeen](https://ballotpedia.org/Haaland_v._Brackeen). It is a complex case that could ultimately result in the Indian Child Welfare Act being declared unconstitutional.

Congress passed the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) in 1978 to provide tribal governments with a voice in the removal and out-of-home placement of Native American children. Prior to the ICWA, many Native American children were forcibly taken away from their parents and extended relatives under the power of the federal government and placed in predominantly non-Native homes, which had no relation to Native American cultures. 

Haaland v. Brackeen involves numerous non-Native couples who wanted to adopt Native children but were opposed by the respective tribal governments. Texas, Louisiana, and Indiana joined the couples to ask the courts to declare the ICWA unconstitutional. District Court Judge Reed O’Connor, a George W. Bush appointee, ruled that the ICWA violated the non-delegation doctrine, the Tenth Amendment, and the Administrative Procedure Act. It was the first time a constitutional challenge to the ICWA had been successful.

A three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed O’Connor’s ruling, but a subsequent en banc hearing [found](https://www.naag.org/attorney-general-journal/supreme-court-report-haaland-v-brackeen-21-376-cherokee-nation-v-brackeen-21-377-texas-v-haaland-21-378-brackeen-v-haaland-21-380/) that the ICWA’s adoptive placement and preference for an ""Indian foster home"" violates equal protection.

Will SCOTUS upend it?” [Desert Sun](https://www.desertsun.com/story/opinion/contributors/valley-voice/2022/08/07/brackeen-v-haaland-supreme-court-may-overturn-indian-child-welfare-act/10240103002/) op-ed.

v8fo0j,Question regarding Rodney Reed (convicted of murdering Stacey Stites),"I have recently taken a deep dive on the case of Stacey Stites and I am not sure where else to ask these questions so hopefully this will be the right place.

A wiki summary of the case for anyone interested :

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Reed

https://www.chillingcrimes.com/blogs/news/stacey-stites

My question:

While Reed was on trial for the murder of Stites, Reed’s DNA was tested against other unsolved rape cases. [His DNA matched that found in relation to the rape and assault of a 12 year old girl.](https://www.kvue.com/article/news/local/rodney-reed-texas-death-row-stacey-stites/269-83d1b2d1-8db2-412f-aae2-afbda9128e48). Because Reed was already on trial for Stites murder the other two rape cases were never brought to trial. My question is, if Reed happened to be acquitted for the murder of Stites would he ever be charged with those two other rape cases and would they go to trial? 

Regardless of what you think about his involvement with Stites, Reed is a dangerous abuser and rapist who should never see the outside of a jail cell. I don’t believe in the death penalty so don’t think he should be sentenced to death but for him to not see any justice for at the very least the rape and assault of the 12 year old would be horrific.",2022-06-09 12:23:50,UnresolvedMysteries,AMissKathyNewman,87,167,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/v8fo0j/question_regarding_rodney_reed_convicted_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/v8fo0j/question_regarding_rodney_reed_convicted_of/,False,False,

smh2s8,"She is scheduled to be executed April 27, 2022","Key Points

1. One of the other children caused the bruises, according to several of the siblings, and the fatal injuries were caused by a fall which at least two of the children witnessed. The child had a deformed foot that caused frequent falls. The deformed foot appears on autopsy photos and is mentioned by family.
2. The forensic pathologist who identified and attributed the abuse has a checkered history in cases involving child deaths.
3. The confession was a classic false confession.
4. The defense attorney hid evidence, including preventing the children from telling the truth about what happened.
5. The case happened in an election year, and it was important to the DA's re election ambitions that he win the case. Immediately after the conviction, Melissa's lawyer was given a plum job at the District Attorney's office.
6. The District Attorney got re elected, but later was sent to prison for throwing cases [https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdtx/pr/former-cameron-county-district-attorney-armando-villalobos-sentenced-federal-prison](https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdtx/pr/former-cameron-county-district-attorney-armando-villalobos-sentenced-federal-prison)
7. Thomas Young, a forensic pathologist hired by the appellate attorney, utterly discredited the 'child abuse' hypothesis. His basic observation was that the witnesses said bruising was not visible before the final injury because there had not been abuse. As time passed the bruises from the stairway fall  became evident and were called 'abuse' injuries.

\*\*\*

“Melissa Lucio faces imminent execution for a capital murder that never happened,”

>“Melissa, an innocent woman, faces execution in less than 100 days because a corrupt prosecutor relied on a statement coerced by an overzealous Texas Ranger who badgered a traumatized woman into making a false confession.”

[https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/news/melissa-lucios-daughter-death-may-have-been-accidental-texas-has-scheduled-her-execution-for-april-27](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/news/melissa-lucios-daughter-death-may-have-been-accidental-texas-has-scheduled-her-execution-for-april-27)

\*\*\*

The child had a turned foot, meaning she walked awkwardly and had fallen down stairs many times. After the death one of the children told an interviewer that she had fallen down a white stairway which was identified as being the exterior staircase. The jurors were prevented from hearing that.

>Children with pigeon toe might trip or fall a lot.

[https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/gait-disorders-pigeon-toe-out-toing-toewalking](https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/gait-disorders-pigeon-toe-out-toing-toewalking)

Even autopsy photos appear to show a deformed in turned foot.

\~

Melissa had a history of cocaine use but no history of violence, neither towards her children nor to others.

At the time the child died Melissa was not using drugs but her husband had started using crack cocaine again.

\~

Her husband was one of two other suspects who turn up if a person investigates a bit, and it appears Melissa was the focus mainly because she was a softer target to get a confession from and to prosecute.

\~

Despite the claims of the pathologist there is not actually any evidence the mother was abusive, and there is no history of child protective services ever finding her to have been abusive. There are problems with the pathologist though.

The children told interviewers that when Melissa got angry at the children for something she would have the children stand in the corner, a sort of 'timeout', and Melissa admitted to spanking her children sometimes.

The testimony about physical injuries to the children includes many physical things that would be consistent with putting a lot of children in a small area, and the Medical Examiner's testimony may not have been as clear cut as has been presented.

On the other hand, the testimony by the children regarding Mariah falling down stairs is consistent. One of the children claimed responsibility for Mariah falling down the stairs, but Melissa's defense attorney declined to call that child as a witness.

The 'expert testimony' in this case has similarities to the 'expert testimony' in the Esar Met case. One expert in that case found no evidence of abuse so the prosecutor brought in another expert who found 'one of the most severe cases of abuse she had seen'.

In this case the 'expert' does not sound especially convincing when she talks about the abuse.

Worse, she specifically was asked by the state of Texas to review the findings in the Rodney Reed case which suggests she was perceived as being useful to the prosecution or 'state'.

The Rodney Reed case was in Bastrop county, near Austin, and she worked in Bexar county which is San Antonio, and in Hidalgo county which is McAllen TX. She had not heard about that case until the state asked her to review it.

>Farley told the defense that she first heard about the Rodney Reed case this year, after being asked to review it by the state’s attorneys

Why would the state go a few counties away to get her into the Rodney Reed case? That case involved heavy criticism of racism by a lot of people outside Texas, and it was important to steer the evidence to favor the state.

She has also been involved in cases where there was real evidence of neglect.

In another recent case the same pathologist ruled another child's death a suicide despite witnesses saying the child fell off a school bus and did not jump. She may have been trying to save the county money from liability. This is still a developing story, but there seem to be indications that pathologist is quite receptive to input from prosecutors and the state.

She resigned abruptly during the height of the pandemic, perhaps under legal pressure, and appears to have relocated to Washington.

Also interesting is that one of her predecessors in Bexar county, Vincent Dimaio, was one of the people who discredited 'shaken baby syndrome,

>The syndrome “doesn't exist,” said Dr. [Vincent DiMaio](https://www.mysanantonio.com/search/?action=search&channel=news%2Flocal&inlineLink=1&searchindex=solr&query=%22Vincent+DiMaio%22), former Bexar County medical examiner.

[https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local\_news/article/Shaken-baby-syndrometarget-of-skepticism-1667706.php](https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local_news/article/Shaken-baby-syndrometarget-of-skepticism-1667706.php)

Notice the article is 4 years after the Melissa Lucio case. He may have been reacting directly to the 'overzealousness' of his successor in identifying child abuse.

And yet another problematic child abuse case which the same pathologist and prosecutor was involved with, in the same court just a year or two before.

>It took three years for a pack of lawyers to compile a 392-page habeus corpus brief to the state. It argued Velez had received utterly incompetent counsel, was prosecuted by a district attorney and convicted by a judge who were themselves [convicted of throwing the book at defendants](http://www.fbi.gov/sanantonio/press-releases/2014/former-cameron-county-district-attorney-armando-villalobos-sentenced-to-federal-prison-in-connection-with-south-texas-bribery-scheme) who wouldn’t pay them bribes, and submitted new evidence from ten expert medical witnesses that suggested Velez was actually innocent. Those are just the highlights.

>Manuel sat in jail for five years until his release. If top lawyers hadn’t found his case, he would probably still be there, or executed

\~

The confession itself is a fairly classic false confession. It has serious logical flaws which the detectives gloss over.

For example once she had gotten to the point where she agreed to confess, the deputy asked her if the girl had made her mad.

That was her cue to create a story about losing her temper, but she was tired and instead just shook her head, so the detective asked ""Then why'd you do it?"" and she tiredly says ""I just did it.""

Her interrogation had aspects of a Reid Technique confession.

At one point she was asked if she was ""a cold blooded killer or a frustrated mother"". She had been credibly denying having caused the death and the interviewer was giving her two choices, one more appealing than the other, but neither true.

It took six or seven hours of police insisting she was guilty and had to confess before the police got a clip that would pass in some courts as a confession.

Despite all the problems with the 'confession', her lawyers made no effort to discredit it for the jurors.

nre4vd,"Ok fellow true crime enthusiasts, lots of cases have muddy waters and controversy. What are some cases you have ~feelings~ about? Cases where the wrong person got punished? Cases where the right person did and others disagree? Cases where there's something missing? Cases you just identify with?","I really want to see how others feel about cases that mean something to them for one reason or another. Even if it's just one that makes you passionate. Here's some of mine:
- Rodney Reed: 
My mom was casual friends with two of his victims, one of whom was murdered. If you're unfamiliar, Mr. Reed was tried in Texas as a black man by an all white jury. However his DNA was found on the victim, he had a pattern of sexual assault including against at least one child (though he was accused of more) and his assaults had a fairly distinct m.o. He was convicted, however years later his cause was taken on by celebrities like Beyonce and Kim Kardashian. His execution was stayed and he still claims he had a consensual relationship with Stacey. The other suspect in the case was her fiance who was a cop. He has in years since exhibited a pattern of violence and sexual abuse as well. 

*My views and perspective:
As a black woman my mother did agree that his trial was clearly biased. However she was also positive that Stacey didn't even know Reed, let alone have some clandestine relationship with him. Given his history she truly believes that he is guilty. She is angry, feeling as though celebrities are supporting him because of racial politics rather than actually taking his history into account. I personally don't think his trial was fair either but I do agree with my mom that he is guilty. My mother also noted that the cop, Jimmy, was a violent and controlling partner. All in all it feels as though Stacey was going to be doomed by marrying him also. This poor girl was in a seriously tough situation at home and fell victim to a predator. 

Delphi:
So I'd love to see some sources on official information or even credible rumors. I've heard one or both girls' families weren't nearly as good and clean as they're portrayed and that somehow that could relate to the case. I truly believe that the investigation was bungled by some backwoods cops who are out of their depths. I don't know anyone involved in the case personally but I'd be interested to hear from anyone who lives near there.",2021-06-03 13:57:28,TrueCrime,DoULiekChickenz,52,69,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueCrime/comments/nre4vd/ok_fellow_true_crime_enthusiasts_lots_of_cases/,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueCrime/comments/nre4vd/ok_fellow_true_crime_enthusiasts_lots_of_cases/,False,False,

m48zbt,"Crime in Bastrop, TX that's not the Rodney Reed case?","I'm hoping Reddit can help me with this...

I was listening to a podcast; I don't remember which one, or even if the narrator was a male or female. They were talking about a crime in Bastrop, TX and at the time, I remember thinking ""Oh I remember that one, I didn't know it happened in Bastrop"". 

So it must've been a popular/famous case, or cult? I feel like if I remember hearing about it, it must've made it to mainstream media, because I lived in Hawaii until a couple years ago. So for news to make it from Texas to Hawaii, it would've been a big case. 

The other thing is, I remember thinking, oh we should drive by the house. We were looking for places to live at the time and looking in Bastrop, so it must've been something that happened in a house? 

I'm sorry I don't have much more to go on. Google searches just turn up the Rodney Reed case and I don't think that's it. It was just one of those things that was bugging me and this is my last ditch effort to remember.

l52nee,Ash overusing AAVE?,"I like their coverage and most of their banter. Nothing is perfect and I do have my issues with the show but one small thing that's really been bugging me is that I feel like Ash uses way too much AAVE (i.e., ""okurrrr"", ""spill the tea"", ""sis"", etc), and oftentimes incorrectly. It just feels fake and gives me an icky feeling. I'm not gonna say it's full-on cultural appropriation, but it just feels.... inauthentic? 

Like, I'm not Black but I grew up with a Black stepdad in the zip code with the highest Black population south of LA in California. I don't even talk like how Ash talks. I grew up around White folks who also grew up in the hood and speak AAVE naturally, and Ash isn't it. I know that for a fact after that Rodney Reed episode when she asked if Black people preferred being called ""Black"" or ""African-American"", which is something you'd know if you had any authentic proximity to Blackness. 

I understand that AAVE has become appropriated heavily into the mainstream, and even more into the LGBTQ community, so I always give people some leeway but I personally feel like she takes it a tad too far. I'm obviously not the AAVE gatekeeper and I'm not gonna die on this hill. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and mine has been informed by the Black people in my family and community. Personally, her incorrect over-usage of AAVE isn't enough to make me stop listening (I just haven't found another true crime podcast that's the same vibe), but it does make me roll my eyes.",2021-01-26 01:14:23,MorbidPodcast,dummie619,4,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/MorbidPodcast/comments/l52nee/ash_overusing_aave/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MorbidPodcast/comments/l52nee/ash_overusing_aave/,False,False,

**Murder of Stacey Stites** [Link to Wikipedia Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Reed#Murder_of_Stacey_Stites)


Stacey Stites, a 19 year old resident of Giddings, Texas, was found dead on April 23, 1996. Police had received a call at 3:11 PM that her unidentified body had been discovered in some bushes near a dirt road behind Bastrop High School in Bastrop, Texas. A pickup truck that belonged to Stites' fiancé that she regularly drove to work had been found earlier, parked at the school nearby.[16][17] The authorities determined that Stites had been beaten, sodomized, and raped before being strangled to death with her own belt some time between 3:00 and 5:00 AM. When discovered in the bushes, Stites was wearing a black bra and jeans. Part of the belt that had been used to kill her was found near her body, and the other part of the belt was found near the truck.  Her body had been partially burned, and her shirt was found nearby.


Stites had lived in Giddings with her fiancé, a local police officer, whom she was scheduled to marry in three weeks.  Her fiancé said he last saw her around 3:00 AM after the couple showered together and she left for work. Bastrop High School was en route from their home in Giddings on the way to her workplace in the produce section at the H-E-B grocery store in Bastrop. After Stites did not arrive for her 3:30 AM shift, the store called her mother, who then called the police.


H-E-B offered a $50,000 reward for information leading to the capture of her killer, but it went unclaimed. On July 12, 1996, an anonymous woman called the authorities once and said she believed that her son may have been with Stites in the hours before she was killed, but the call could not be traced.
Stites was buried in her hometown[15] of Corpus Christi on April 26, 1996.  Her brother never recovered from her death and committed suicide in 1997.


**Arrest and trial**


The authorities began to suspect Rodney Reed had been involved in the Stites murder based on similarities in the case to an attack on another woman six months later on November 9, 1996. Linda Schlueter, age 19, had agreed to give a ride to a man she met after stopping at a drive-up payphone at a now-closed Long's Star Mart. When she went to drop him off, he attacked her and said he would kill her for resisting him, but then fled the scene with her vehicle after seeing car lights approaching. Reed was detained by police based on Schlueter's description, and she subsequently picked him out of a photo line-up. The police department had been familiar with him because of prior arrests.
Schlueter's vehicle was found close to where Stites's pickup truck had been abandoned at Bastrop High School.[23] DNA extracted from three sperm found in Stites' vagina and saliva found on her chest matched to Reed. Local law enforcement already had Reed's DNA on file from a investigation into an alleged rape of a woman with intellectual disabilities in May 1995. Reed was officially charged with the murder of Stacey Stites on April 4, 1997, and held without bond. At the time, he was already in jail on an unrelated charge.[19] He was indicted and ""charged with two counts of capital murder, one for murder in the course of aggravated sexual assault and one for murder in the course of kidnapping.""[28] His arraignment was scheduled for May 29, 1997,  and jury selection began in March 1998.[29] The jury was described as ""mostly white"", with no African-Americans among the 12 jurors or two alternates.[16] The case against Reed rested heavily upon the DNA evidence, with no additional physical evidence or eyewitness testimony.


Upon his initial questioning by police and before he learned about the DNA evidence, Reed denied knowing Stites outside of what he had heard in news reports.[14] At trial, Reed's defense attorneys, Lydia Clay-Jackson and Calvin Garvey, argued that there had actually been a clandestine sexual relationship between Reed and Stites.[16][30] Reed said that he initially denied knowing Stites because it would be best for him not to admit to knowing ""a dead white girl"" and later because ""I knew she was seeing a cop, and we're in the South. There's still a lot of racism going on."" The prosecutors noted that Reed had previously used a similar defense of a clandestine affair when charged with a different aggravated rape in 1987 which had led to him being acquitted.


According to prosecutor Lisa Tanner, DNA evidence was taken from 15 suspects, including Stites' fiancé and individuals who allegedly confessed to or bragged about the killing. DNA testing eliminated everyone except Reed as the source of the semen. Police investigators could find no one who would attest to a relationship between Reed and Stites, including her mother and sister, and the defense brought forward no witnesses who could testify to the affair.  Further, Stites' mother claimed that her daughter and her fiancé ""looked happy and in love. The prosecution put forward the DNA evidence and speculated that Reed may have ambushed Stites at a railroad crossing or a stoplight on her way to work the morning of the murder.


Reed was convicted on May 18, 1998, after a jury deliberation of six hours. Stites' family and friends were relieved by the conviction.   Reed's family wept, because they were convinced that he was innocent.  He was sentenced to death on May 28, 1998, after a deliberation of four hours.  During sentencing, prosecutors pushed for the death penalty by arguing that Reed was likely to pose a danger in the future based on a history of similar previous charges. To bolster their case, the prosecution brought forward women Reed allegedly raped: Schlueter, a 12 year old girl, the intellectually disabled woman, and a woman named Vivian Harbottle to testify against him in the penalty phase. The prosecution asserted that DNA found on them matched Reed.


**Appeals and stays of execution**


Reed has unsuccessfully appealed nine times on grounds of ignored witnesses and evidence that may have raised reasonable doubt but was not handed over to defense attorneys because prosecutors claimed that it was irrelevant.  Reed's attorneys have subsequently argued that the broken belt used in the murder has never been tested for DNA, and that forensic experts have admitted to making errors in their testimony.[2] His case has since been taken up by the Innocence Project.


Reed was scheduled to be executed on January 14, 2015, but the execution was rescheduled to March 5, 2015, based on a request by the state.  On February 23, 2015, his execution was stayed to allow the consideration of further evidence. His execution was later rescheduled for November 20, 2019.



In the weeks preceding the November execution date, celebrities such as Kim Kardashian West, Rihanna, Beyoncé, Meek Mill, Pusha T, Susan Sarandon, Seth Green, and Oprah Winfrey publicly urged Texas Governor Greg Abbott to exonerate Reed or stay his execution. Some, such as Amanda Seales, have rescinded their support for Reed's exoneration after learning more about his history.  The case received coverage in major news outlets, and Reed was interviewed on an episode of Dr. Phil, in which host Phil McGraw opined that Reed should not be executed because he had not received a fair trial.  By November 14, 2019, a petition to free Reed started by Shaun King had reportedly garnered more than three million signatures. 
A bipartisan group of 16 Texas state senators has petitioned Abbott to stay the death penalty on grounds that new, possibly exculpatory evidence had come to light.  On November 15, 2019, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles unanimously recommended that Texas Governor Greg Abbott grant Reed a 120-day reprieve.  Later that day, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals indefinitely stayed Reed's execution to review claims of Brady violations, false testimony, and actual innocence. 
On February 24, 2020, the Supreme Court announced that it would not be taking up Reed's appeal, citing ongoing litigation in lower courts.

**Here are key facts you should know about his case:**
Rodney Reed, who maintains his innocence, has been on death row for more than 22 years for the murder of Stacey Stites in Bastrop, Texas. Since his trial, substantial evidence exonerating Rodney and implicating Stacey’s then-fiancé Jimmy Fennell, a former local police officer, has come to light. Rodney was recently granted an indefinite , just before his scheduled execution date of November 20, 2019, and is now awaiting a new hearing. Rodney now has another chance to prove his innocence, but he’s not free yet.  You can help support Rodney’s fight for justice by sharing this article and .
 

1. The murder weapon has never been tested for DNA evidence. Requests for DNA testing of crime scene evidence, including of a belt that was used as the murder weapon, have been repeatedly denied by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. And the United States Supreme Court declined to directly review the Texas courts’ denial of DNA testing in 2018.


2. The State’s three forensic experts have admitted on the record to errors in their testimonies, which led to Rodney’s conviction and death sentence. The three forensic experts from Rodney’s original trial have since submitted affidavits stating that Stacey’s original time of death is inaccurate, which makes the prosecution’s timeline of Rodney allegedly killing her implausible.


3. **Rodney Reed and Stacey Stites were having a consensual sexual relationship.** At the time of the trial, no one came forward to corroborate their relationship. But today, new witnesses including Stacey’s own cousin and co-worker have corroborated Rodney’s claim that they knew that he and Stacey were romantically involved.

4. Renowned forensic pathologists, including Michael Baden, M.D., Werner Spitz, M.D., LeRoy Riddick, M.D., and Cyril Wecht, M.D., have all concluded that Rodney’s guilt is medically and scientifically impossible. The prosecution’s only forensic evidence linking Rodney to the crime was semen taken from Stacey’s body, which was attributed to the consensual relationship between them. The prosecution used this to connect him to the murder and refute their consensual romantic relationship, but the testimony supporting this theory has since been recanted, completely discrediting the State’s case.


5. For months after the murder, Jimmy Fennell, Stacey’s fiancé, was the prime suspect in the case. A recording of one of the police investigators indicates that Jimmy was suspected in Stacey’s murder, and he was believed to be motivated by her relationship with another man. 

6. Jimmy’s best friend at the time of the crime, Bastrop Sheriff’s Officer Curtis Davis, has now revealed that Jimmy gave an inconsistent account of where he was on the night of the murder. Jimmy had told his friend he was out drinking on the night Stacey was murdered. But he later stated he was with Stacey in the apartment they shared during what we now know was the actual time of her death, based on Dr. Michael Baden’s updated testimony, which contradicts his initial claim. When asked to explain this discrepancy, Jimmy declined to testify because his answers might further incriminate him.


7. Two witnesses have recently come forward and submitted signed affidavits that add to the mounting evidence against Jimmy Fennell. These affidavits include testimony from an insurance salesperson who stated that Jimmy threatened to kill Stacey while applying for life insurance. The second witness was a Deputy in the Lee County Sheriff’s Office at the time of the murder to whom Jimmy made an alarming and incriminating statement regarding Stacey’s body at her funeral.


8. Jimmy later served a 10-year prison term for a sex crime and kidnapping. Law enforcement records also document a pattern of violence against women perpetrated by Jimmy.


9. This case was racially charged. Rodney, a black man, was found guilty of murdering Stacey, a white woman, by an all-white jury.

10. A confession by Jimmy Fennell has come to light. On October 29, 2019 Arthur Snow, a former member of the Aryan Brotherhood and Jimmy’s prisonmate, disclosed that Jimmy had confessed to murdering Stacey stating, “I had to kill my n*****-loving fiancée,” in a conversation.

The first thing I read about this case was the above from the Innocence Project.  It wasn’t until I googled that I saw he had been ACCUSED of raping other women.

hpsrwy,"How true crime documentaries lie to you: Rodney Reed on ""Death Again""","True crime shows will sometimes lie to the viewer. Often they will embellish the story to make it more entertaining, but at other times they have a clear agenda with their portrayal of the case, as seen with this 2 minute clip:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64h2K8IHGfI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64h2K8IHGfI)

The above video clip is from the A&E TV show ""Dead Again"" which ran from 2014-2015. The premise of the show relies on seasoned detectives re-investigating closed cases, with new eyes and no biases. Sometimes they go against the official ruling on the case, finding the true perpetrators. It sounds noble enough, but as you'll come to learn, the show is often misleading and leaves out crucial details of the crime, in order to bolster their narrative regarding  the case. In this case, they try to make, at the time of filming soon to be executed, Rodney Reed appear innocent through lies of omission. 

For those not familiar with the case that convicted Reed, I'll provide a short overview, before we continue.

**Short overview of the case:**

On April 23th, 1996, Stacey Stites failed to show up for her 3:30 am shift at the supermarket H.E.B in Bastrop, Texas. A worried coworker called Stites’ mother early that morning, and a search was started. Around 8 am, her vehicle was found in the parking lot at Bastrop high school.  The same day at approximately 3pm, her partially clothed body was discovered by a passerby. The body showed signs of rape; the fly on her pants was broken, and semen was found inside her vaginal cavity. The prime suspect was her fiancé, Jimmy Fennell, a junior officer with the Giddings police force. His DNA however didn't match the DNA in the body and investigators found he couldn’t physically have gotten from Giddings to Bastrop and back in the allowed timeframe. The case then went cold for almost 1 year, until Police matched the DNA with an African American man named Rodney Reed. Reed was sentenced to death in 1998, and has since his trial claimed that he was in a secret relationship with Stacey Stites, but that her fiancé found out, killed her and framed Reed for the crime. A defense which gained some credence in 2007, when Jimmy Fennell pleaded guilty to an unrelated rape, and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.

I will not go into further depth regarding Reed's guilt, as this is not what this post is about.

**""Dead Again"" vs the Court documents:**

[0:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64h2K8IHGfI)

* *""We got an alibi. We just spoke to Chris Aldridge… and zero doubt that he was with Rodney the night of this murder.""*

[0:15](https://youtu.be/64h2K8IHGfI?t=15)

* *“I’ll assure you this, that’s definitely enough for me; for a retrial.""*
* ""*I agree with you guys. The jury deserved the opportunity to hear what the witness said (…)”*

Chris Aldridge, who is Reed’s cousin and has a long arrest record, has been taken in multiple lies and or inconsistencies in his affidavits, which is the likely reason why the defense didn’t call on him to witness at trial. Aldridge claims that when he first meet Stacey, she was driving a large full-size pick-up truck. \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587\_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf) \- page 178a\] However: *“The trial judge found that the only truck Stacey drove belonged to Fennell and that it was not a full-size truck.”* [https://law.justia.com/cases/texas/court-of-criminal-appeals/2008/17748.html](https://law.justia.com/cases/texas/court-of-criminal-appeals/2008/17748.html)

Furthermore, Aldridge said at one time prior to the murder, Fennel had driven up Aldridge and Reed in a Bastrop sheriff department vehicle and threatened Reed. At the time Fennell wasn’t with the Bastrop sheriff department. He was a junior officer with Giddings police force, having no reason to be driving a Bastrop police vehicle. \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587\_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf) \- page 178a\]

Aldridge also stated that he knew that the man was Fennell, because Fennell had booked had him into jail in the past. The bookings sheets of Aldridge however found that Fennell hadn’t been Aldridge’s jailor at any point. \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587\_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf) – page 179a\]

Lastly Aldridge claimed that Reed, Stacey and himself would drive around and smoke crack cocaine. Testing did not reveal Stacey to be a user of cocaine. Likewise was her H.E.B employment drug screening negative for any drugs. Hair sample analysis found that she hadn’t been a user cocaine in the last 32 months of her life. \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587\_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf) \- page 179a\]

As you can see there is good reason not to trust Chris Aldridge as Reed's alibi and as a witness to the alleged affair.

[0:35:](https://youtu.be/64h2K8IHGfI?t=35)

* *""And this was a test that was done on the two beer cans that was found at the crime-scene. The DNA came back to one specific police officer.""*
* ""*Ok, so is that one police-officer, Dustin \[Fennell\]?*
* ""*No it wasn't; it was actually his best friend, who was a local cop. He lived in the apartment complex with Dustin \[Fennell\] and Stacey.""*

Initial, very broad, DQ-Alpha DNA testing could not exclude the victim, Stacey Stites and two cops, Ed Selmela/Salmela (spelling differs), who was investigating the murder, and lastly David Hall, who is the best friend they are referring to in the clip. \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587\_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf) \- page 125a\]

A more thorough polymarker DNA test done by the defense’s own expert, Dr. Johnson however, ruled out all three as contributors of the DNA on the beer cans in 1998. \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587\_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf) \- page 181a\]\[[https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808\_1de45a41ffd241b58973b742c5a617b7.pdf](https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808_1de45a41ffd241b58973b742c5a617b7.pdf) \- page 24\]

It is very misleading of them to say that David Hall was a match, when he in reality he just couldn’t be excluded initially- and it’s further nullified when he was eventually totally ruled out as the contributor of the DNA by a more exhaustive test. 

[1:03:](https://youtu.be/64h2K8IHGfI?t=63)

* *""And you know what? Our big question here with Dustin \[Fennell\] is how did he get home after dumping the vehicle at the school.""*

[1:21:](https://youtu.be/64h2K8IHGfI?t=81)

* *“Dustin then drives to the school, dumps the car there, catches a ride back to his residence with his buddy who lives in the same apartment complex.""*

David Hall has an alibi for the night of the murder. His wife Carla Hall testified that she was sure he was in bed with her at 3:30 am because their 2 month old daughter woke them both up by screaming. There’s no proof that he was out of the house on the night of the murder, making this theory unlikely. \[[https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808\_1de45a41ffd241b58973b742c5a617b7.pdf](https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808_1de45a41ffd241b58973b742c5a617b7.pdf) \- page 206-207\]

Reed's counsel has still not presented a possible explanation for how Fennell could have dumped the body and truck in Bastrop, but could have been back in Giddings at about 6:45 am when Stacey's mother called him on the landline in apartment he shared with Stacey.  \[[https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808\_fe76d15949a44c01abf1f30528ec2b9a.pdf](https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808_fe76d15949a44c01abf1f30528ec2b9a.pdf) \- page 69-70\] We know that Stacey's body wasn't where it would later be found, at 4:00 am, because a newspaper-delivery person  didn't see it on their route through the area. \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587\_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf) \- page 112a\] Futhermore The patrol-officer who found the truck, before Stacey was reported missing, didn't notice it on his prior drive though area around the high school, but it made a note of it and reported it in at 5:23 am.  \[[https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808\_e2acea13faee428d8fee741fc63b438e.pdf](https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808_e2acea13faee428d8fee741fc63b438e.pdf) \- page 117-118\] This means the perpetrator would have dumped the truck somewhere after 4:00 am but before 5:23 am, giving Fennell less than 3 hours to make the trip back to Giddings.

* ""*How did a jury not get to hear any of this?""*
* ""*HOW?! They've got this guy’s DNA right next to the body!""*

The jury didn't get to hear it, because as I pointed out above, the DNA on the beer cans was ruled as not relevant to the case, based on the exclusion found during the more thorough polymarker test. 

The  show is making it appear as if the prosecution was deliberately not releasing evidence that could hurt their case of putting a possibly innocent man behind bars; thus making them look very untrustworthy if not directly corrupt. The truth is that the evidence was faulty to begin, and best case scenario could have been used to mislead the jury into acquitting, based only on a partial match, which was already ruled out at trial.

All of the evidence they bring up in this short clip from 2015 was put to bed the by courts as far back as 2001, during Reed's evidentiary hearing. \[[https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808\_0a6c3dcfcc554e4fb534c3a7d28a7c97.pdf](https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808_0a6c3dcfcc554e4fb534c3a7d28a7c97.pdf) \- page 78-79\]",2020-07-12 11:11:28,TrueCrimeDiscussion,ssp92,17,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueCrimeDiscussion/comments/hpsrwy/how_true_crime_documentaries_lie_to_you_rodney/,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueCrimeDiscussion/comments/hpsrwy/how_true_crime_documentaries_lie_to_you_rodney/,False,False,

hlt71x,Second Chance: Heroes vs Villains,"so it feels like two of the most highly requested seasons are second chances 2 and heroes vs villains 2. while i'm on board for both, there's only room for so many returnee seasons, so i started to think about whether the two ideas could be combined. here's my take on what a ballot for that might look like:


**hero boys:**

christian

davie

devon

devens

hayden

terry

michael

sean


**hero girls:**

gabby

janet

elaine

rimmer

jenn

kelly goldsmith

michelle yi 

ali

alternates: wes, chet, t bird, aurora


**villain girls:**

napalm natalie

angelina

natalie bolton

chrissy

reem

victoria

j'tia

rc 


**villain boys:**

chris noble

dom

rodney

wardog

zane

dean

ace

reed

alternates: vince, drew, noura, carolyn


(i'm trying to make this semi realistic so no kellee/shane/jay/greg/etc)

out of this cast, i anticipate christian, davie, devon, devens, and terry/michael making it for the hero guys, gabby, janet, elaine, rimmer, and jenn/goldsmith making it for the hero girls, angelina, chrissy, and three of the others making it for the villain girls (i honestly think any of the six remaining have a decent shot besides maybe rc), and dom, noble, wardog, dean, and rodney/reed for the male villains. that means the final cast would look something like

**heroes:**

christian

davie

devens

devon

terry

gabby

janet

elaine

rimmer

goldsmith


**villains:**

angelina

chrissy

natalie bolton

hlong4,Fran Hart's Fabulous Frocks and Happy Haberdashery Series End Notes,"Hi all, and welcome any newcomers!

I finally posted the ending to Fran's series yesterday - if you haven't read it yet, find it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/hl1lm5/i_own_a_boutique_that_offers_full_body/) and don't read any further until you have! There will be spoilers abound. 😉

The main spoiler - though several of you guessed it quite early on!! - is, of course, Fran's backstory. I'm a nonbinary individual, and although I am personally not very attached to the concept of gender, I understand how incredibly important it is to so many people... especially when one's gender is denied or rejected. The entire series and her character were conceived out of a desire to see more trans/gender non-conforming representation on NoSleep and horror in general. (Side note - a big reason why I decided to allow users to designate their own flair was so folks could put their pronouns next to their usernames, if desired. And/or just silly nicknames, of course!)

I think we all know that trans representation would come best from trans writers themselves, but I'm hoping to have done as good of a job as I possibly can despite not being a trans woman myself. I drew on my own experiences as a nonbinary individual, and through reading content written by trans women. I crafted Fran with more love and heart than I have most of my other characters; I genuinely, deeply, love her. I would love to get feedback from any of my trans readers - if there is something that sat wrong with you in Fran's characterization, *please* reach out... especially if I wrote anything that felt hurtful or harmful. The last thing I want to do is perpetuate more harm, and I will change whatever necessary to avoid doing so.

I've been moved to tears by the overwhelmingly positive response to this finale. I must admit that I held my breath a bit before posting it... the internet can be a cruel place, after all. The fact that Fran has not only been tolerated, but accepted and *celebrated* by the community warms my heart. I am overjoyed that her series secured my first contest win; her story will be seen by so many more people as part of the contest archives. I really hope to see more trans/GNC representation on NoSleep, especially from trans/GNC authors. 🖤

Like normal, I'd like to go through all the parts to give some extra comments!

* It was so fun to build Fran's world in the first part; it's very specifically laid out in my mind. The first customer is absolutely inspired by Karla Homolka - I must admit I really struggled with walking the line between making her character too sympathetic vs. completely unsympathetic. I wanted it to feel justified that she would not walk away unscathed, but also deserving of a second chance. Most of the feedback was validating just that, but I did upset a few folks who felt Fran was punishing her for being abused. This broke my heart, and I really had to be careful in the upcoming parts to make sure that Fran herself was viewed sympathetically.
* If there was some negative feedback to part one, I was absolutely convinced part two would turn the internet against me. This one took a *lot* of careful thought and planning. I mostly write from my own perspective, and thus hadn't addressed racism in any of my stories yet. However, I wanted to firmly align myself with anti-racism here. I know many people were expecting the politician to undergo a ""race change"", but I didn't feel it was appropriate or meaningful enough. The tattooed man was actually my first thought, but I originally toyed with the idea of fitting him in a racist skinhead's look. This felt like it would just cause more harm, and I really struggled to find something more appropriate. The two-faced tattoo came to me in one of those rare ""a-ha!!"" moments - it connected to Dantalion's appearance in the politician's story, and spoke to his personality.
* Ren's story was... a joy to write. I based her story loosely off of Anneliese Michel's, intertwining the characteristics I've seen in some of the students I've worked with. While not explicitly written, Ren is autistic and was heavily misunderstood by her family - with the right supports, she is able to thrive in Fran's shop. I originally was not planning on having Fran take Ren in, but as the story came to a close... it just seemed like the only choice she would have made.
* Personally, part four is not my favorite. I was kind of in a hurry and lacking motivation, so I'm glad I was able to even get something together! Oddly enough, it was very, very loosely inspired by Rodney Reed, and of course the original story of gaslighting. I put in some personal experiences I've had in relationships as well. I wanted to make sure I got a story in where Fran purposefully fitted a customer in a high profile look before closing the series, and this is what came out, ha!
* We've already been over part five a bit, but I only decided exactly what Chloe's consultation story would be the day before posting the finale. I knew exactly what Chloe had done to Fran from the very beginning, but I needed a horror element badly. I've been watching the show Pose (if you haven't seen it - it's a must!) and the main character's mom mentions seeing ""a little girl sneaking around the house""... after that, it was a no-brainer. This was a sad, sad one to write, but I needed it to feel completely justified for Fran to kill her in the end.

I've left the series open on purpose - I will likely write additional installments in the future. In my mind, Fran is on a hiatus; she's not *gone* gone. I need time to come up with more ideas so it does not feel so formulaic or redundant moving forward, and I don't have that time right now. These will likely be released under a slightly different name, and I'll probably incorporate Ren a bit more into future stories; she may even narrate one or two.

Any future additions are on the back burner, so I'm not sure what the timeline on that would be like. If and when I'm ready to release a few more stories from Fran's world, I will absolutely keep you all in the loop! You'll also see her pop up elsewhere very soon, so keep your eyes peeled!!

As always, thank you so much for your support. I am feeling extra grateful for you all today. 🖤",2020-07-05 15:41:43,hercreation,hercreation,87,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/hercreation/comments/hlong4/fran_harts_fabulous_frocks_and_happy_haberdashery/,https://www.reddit.com/r/hercreation/comments/hlong4/fran_harts_fabulous_frocks_and_happy_haberdashery/,False,False,

gq80vy,True crime documentaries lying to the audience - A snippet from another case: Rodney Reed on Dead Again,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64h2K8IHGfI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64h2K8IHGfI)

The video linked above is a 2 minute clip from the A&E TV show Dead Again from 2015, a show in which a group of ragtag no nonsense detectives reinvestigate old cases with new eyes and decades worth of crime investigation experience. Watch as the grizzled detectives, underlined by dramatic music right out of a soap opera, blatantly lie to the audience,  in order to make Rodney Reed appear innocent, by leaving out crucial details of the case.

Here’s the important details left out in the above clip:

**0:00**

* *""We got an alibi. We just spoke to Chris Aldridge… and zero doubt that he was with Rodney the night of this murder.""*

**0:15**

* *“I’ll assure you this, that’s definitely enough for me; for a retrial.*
* *I agree with you guys. The jury deserved the opportunity to hear what the witness said (…)”*

Chris Aldridge, who is Reed’s Cousin and has a long arrest record, has been taken in multiple lies and or inconsistencies in his affidavits, which is the likely reason why the defense didn’t call on him to witness at trial. He claims when he first meet Stacey, she was driving a large full-size pick-up truck. \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587\_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf) \- page 178a\] However: *“The trial judge found that the only truck Stacey drove belonged to Fennell and that it was not a full-size truck.”*  [https://law.justia.com/cases/texas/court-of-criminal-appeals/2008/17748.html](https://law.justia.com/cases/texas/court-of-criminal-appeals/2008/17748.html)

Furthermore, Aldridge said that Fennell at one time prior to the murder had come and threatened  Rodney, and that he was driving a Bastrop sheriff department vehicle, but at the time Fennell wasn’t with the Bastrop sheriff department. He was a junior officer with Giddings police force, having no reason to be driving a Bastrop police vehicle.

Aldridge also stated that he knew that the man was Fennell, because Fennell had booked had him into jail in the past. The bookings sheets of Aldridge however found that Fennell hadn’t been Aldridge’s jailor at any point.  \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587\_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf) – page 179a\]

Lastly Aldridge claimed that Rodney, Stacey and he would drive around and smoke crack cocaine. Hair sample analysis did not reveal Stacey to be a user of cocaine. Likewise was her H.E.B employment drug screening negative for any drugs. The testing found that she hadn’t used cocaine in the last 32 months of her life, tearing Aldridge already tarnished credibility to shreds. \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587\_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf) \- page 179a\]

**0:34:**

* *""And this was a test that was done on the two beer cans that was found at the crime-scene. The DNA came back to one specific police officer.*
* *Ok, so is that one police-officer, Dustin \[Fennell\]?*
* *No it wasn't; it was actually his best friend, who was a local cop. He lived in the apartment complex with Dustin \[Fennell\] and Stacey.""*

Initial, very broad, DQ-Alpha DNA testing could not exclude the victim, Stacey Stites and two cops, Ed Selmela/Salmela (spelling differs), who was investigating the murder, and lastly David Hall, who is the best friend they are referring to in the clip. \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587\_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf) \- page 125a\]

A more thorough polymarker DNA test done by the defense’s own expert, Dr. Johnson however, ruled out all three as contributors of the DNA on the beer cans in 1998. \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587\_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf) \- page 181a\]

It is very misleading of them to say that David Hall was a match, when he in reality he just couldn’t be excluded initially- and it’s further nullified when he was eventually totally ruled out as the contributor of the DNA by a more exhaustive test.

**1:03:**

* *""And you know what? Our big question here with Dustin \[Fennell\] is how did he get home after dumping the vehicle at the school.*

**1:21:**

* *“Dustin then drives to the school, dumps the car there, catches a ride back to his residence with his buddy who lives in the same apartment complex.*

David Hall had an alibi for the night of the murder. His wife Carla Hall testified that she was sure he was in bed with her at 3:30am because their daughter woke them both up by screaming very loudly. There’s no proof that he was out of the house on the night of the murder, making this theory unlikely. \[[https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808\_1de45a41ffd241b58973b742c5a617b7.pdf](https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808_1de45a41ffd241b58973b742c5a617b7.pdf) \- page 206-207\]

**1:31:**

* *""What was really startling about this whole evidence though; the Jury never got to hear any of this...*
* *How did a jury not get to hear any of this?*
* *HOW?! They've got this guy’s DNA right next to the body!*
* *The prosecution did not divulge that piece of evidence to the defense.""*

The jury didn't get to hear it, because what you're loudly proclaiming as a match, was ruled a being not a match. Best case scenario the defense could have used this wideranging DQ-Alpha DNA match, to mislead the jury into the acquitting. This issue was also addressed during Rodney Reed's evidentiary hearing in 2001 and dismissed by the court, based primarily on the exclusion of the person(s) of interest. \[[https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808\_0a6c3dcfcc554e4fb534c3a7d28a7c97.pdf](https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808_0a6c3dcfcc554e4fb534c3a7d28a7c97.pdf) \- page 78-79.\]

Since Reed's counsel didn't get to use this ""evidence"" to mislead the jury in 1998, how good of you now use now it to mislead your audience, as well as trying to mislead them into thinking the prosecution deliberately didn't hand it over to the defense, to make their case stronger. The irony. . .

All of that damage done in just 124 seconds of prime time TV. . . And that’s without addressing the last bit were they’re suggesting that Ed Selmala,  an investigator of the Stites murder, who killed himself, was actually murdered by Jimmy Fennell, trying turn it into an even bigger conspiracy and cover-up.

The juiciest part is that the ring (mis)leader of the trio, Kevin Gannon is now openly siding with Reed's counsel as an expert on the case, as if he wasn't fed all this exculpatory ""evidence"" by them before the show started filming.",2020-05-25 09:32:02,StevenAveryIsGuilty,ssp92,14,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/StevenAveryIsGuilty/comments/gq80vy/true_crime_documentaries_lying_to_the_audience_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/StevenAveryIsGuilty/comments/gq80vy/true_crime_documentaries_lying_to_the_audience_a/,False,False,

When this case blew up last year, one thing I notice was there is zero mention of when/ where he supposedly met her before they began their alleged affair. Even now every article, and Wikipedia, completely glosses over this important detail. If his story is true, why has this never been mention? You would think at some point someone would have written an article, about how the two met and started a forbidden love that ended in tragedy. None of these articles say anything like “they met at a bar “ or “he met her at her job”. There is nothing out there about this and I think it’s pretty damming.

gb8n9k,"Konfidential KUWTK Producer Secrets - Season 18, Episode 5","Hi everybody; I hope you are all safe and healthy during these crazy times!

Here is this week’s “Kards Konfidential” — inside details on *last week’s* episode, “Surprise, Surprise.” And what a surprise of an episode it *was* **indeed**. There were so many highlights, but nothing tops watching Kim, Kourtney and Khloe ~~watching paint dry~~ pretending to be interested in Corey’s birthday.

This week’s plots were Kim and Khloe pulling Corey out of Kris’s bedroom for a plot line now that Rob and Kylie have fulfilled their seasonal on-camera time, Khloe mentally preparing (and failing) us for more bad decisions involving he-who-must-not-be-named, and Kim K. using her newfound lawyer tactics to score free Oreo McFlurries out of the hard working hands of some McDonalds employees.

**Scene 1: Kendall’s 24th Birthday Party**

* Kendall’s birthday party was at the Blind Dragon in West Hollywood.
* Producers say Scott and Rob are low-key about their birthday plans.
* Other celebrities in attendance were Leonardo DiCaprio, The Weeknd, and Kacey Musgraves

**Scene 2: Kim talks to her friend Allison about surprising Kris for her birthday**

* Allison is Kim’s oldest and closest friend. Producers say they’re like sisters and have been best friends since elementary school.
* On average, Kim has at least two or three photo shoots per week.
* When shooting for her own brands, Kim works closely with the photographer to come up with an exact look for every product. Producers say she’s very hands-on and knows what she wants.
* Kris keeps every single magazine cover featuring any of her kids in her office. She has stacks of them.
* The family all has their own storage units for archiving clothes and other memorabilia. Kim has archived all her favorite looks she’s worn over the years.

**Scene 3: Khloe at Dr. Huang’s office talking about freezing her eggs**

* Dr. Huang also helped Kim and Kourtney freeze their egg.
* While Kim has more kids than any of her siblings, producers think Kylie could be the one to eventually have the most.
* Over the years, a few members of production have also worked with Dr. Huang to freeze their eggs.
* All of Khloe’s appointments were filmed with one producer using an iPhone to document the process. A total of eight appointments were filmed but were cut for time.

**Scene 4: Kim/Khloe devise a plan to surprise Corey for his birthday**

* Kim usually requests Cheetos, a specific brand of wafer cookies, and chocolate peanut butter cups on set.
* Khloe and Kim give each other compliments or feedback at shoots to be encouraging, especially when they’re doing things outside their comfort zones.
* Producers noticed a big shift in the relationship between Corey and the girls over the past year, and especially when the Napa planning took shape.

**Scene 5: Kim surprises Kris on her birthday**

* It’s hard to surprise Kris because she has her hand in all the girls’ schedules and knows every detail on her own. Producers say she’ll ask lots of questions and need every detail, so you have to be prepared.
* Event planner Mindy Weiss helped Kim plan the surprise for Kris.
* Kris’ birthday is November 5th.
* It was a long process for Kim to get permission to use her childhood home - she wrote and called several times. It wasn’t until she knocked on the door and met the owners that they came around to the idea.
* Kim thought about buying the house, say producers. But she knew the owners were not interested in selling.
* Each Kardashian child - Kourtney, Kim, Khloe, and Rob - were born in the house Kim rented.
* It took all the guests 15 minutes to get from the Beverly Hills Hotel to the house.
* Kim said the only thing missing from the party was her dad. She wishes he could’ve been there.
* To respect the current owners’ privacy, nobody was allowed to take photos or videos of the property.

u/LinusRanger13 SIDE NOTE: I was disappointed that we didn’t get to see the girls visit their old house. I understand that the family that now lives there didn’t want cameras, but after seeing all of the girls’ IG stories of them surprising Kris at the hotel (the day it actually happened), it was something I was looking forward to!

**Scene 6: Recapping Kris’ birthday/Khloe and Kim ignore Kris as she prepares for Corey’s birthday**

* Lunch was served with Kris’ favorite foods on the tennis courts. It included Kris’ favorite salad from La Scala that she always used to get. They also recreated the kitchen setup, where they used to spend so much time together as a family.
* Producers say everyone in the family is a little bit self-conscious about eating while being filmed.
* Kris and Khloe have the loudest personalities of all the girls. They feed off that when they’re together.
* Kris didn’t suspect anything even though Khloe almost started laughing when Kris brought up Palm Springs.
* When given a guilt trip by Kris, everyone in the family usually caves, especially when it involves personal stuff…unless there’s some other aspect involved - like a surprise.

**Scene 7: Kim discussing Rodney Reed’s case at a photoshoot / Tracy Romulus fulfilling Kourtney’s screen time**

* It’s always a process coordinating the girls’ calendars, glam teams, stylists, photographers, and studios for photo shoots.
* Producers have been asked to give honest feedback on new Kardashian products, but they also have teams that test with focus groups for the products.
* Producers were not surprised Kim decided to pursue a career in law. She’s always had a sharp sense - they always said Kim could’ve been an attorney in a different life.
* Kim’s dad is her lawyer’s inspiration.

**Scene 8: The family celebrating Dream’s birthday without actually showing Dream because Blac Chyna most likely didn’t grant permission for the cameras / Rob (!!) tells Kim/Khloe about Corey’s birthday dinner**

* Now that Kylie has thrown “StormiWorld” two years in a row, producers say there’s definitely unspoken pressure to top all the kids’ parties.
* Sometimes the kids sit with producers and watch their parents on the monitors for fun. They’ll even speak into the walkies.
* Of all Kris’ kids, Kylie is the closest with Corey. Producers say they have a really good relationship and spend a lot of time together.
* The family celebrates producers’ birthdays by giving gifts, making toasts, or bringing out a cake.

**Scene 9: Kendall asks to see a picture of Khloe’s baby daddy**

* Things got much better with Kim, Khloe, and Kourtney after Kourtney took a step back from filming.
* At this point, about a month had gone by since Kourtney decided to film less.
* Since Kourtney started filming less, producers actually reach out to her more.
* Tristan has said that he wanted to have 5 or 6 kids with Khloe.
* Producers say Khloe wasn’t apprehensive about sharing her egg freezing journey. She wanted to share her experience in hopes of helping others considering the same.

**Scene 10: Kim workin’ beyond the 9 to 5 and talks to Rodney Reed on the phone**

* Producers say no one in the family is exactly comfortable with acting, but they get by.
* Some shoots allow a full crew, while others only allow a single producer with a handheld cam.
* Rihanna, T.I., and Meek Mill were other celebrities advocating for Rodney Reed’s release. He was sentenced to death in 1998.

**Scene 11: Kourtney, Kim, and Khloe “surprise” Corey on a private jet**

* Kylie didn’t come to Napa because she’d already celebrated Corey’s birthday, and Kendall had another work obligation.
* The “Dallas Cowboys” donuts were from Spudnuts Donuts.
* There was no backup plan if Kris and Corey refused to come. Producers say Kim was confident the idea of buying a plane would get Kris there quickly.
* Producers say Khloe can be hard to surprise. She’s so perceptive and can pick up on anything that might seem weird, and ends up blowing it.
* Khloe’s egg retrieval date kept changing and producers were concerned it would fall over the Napa trip. Luckily, she was able to shift the dates to make both work.
* Matthew packed for Corey too. And nothing was forgotten. Producers say Matthew’s a pro at packing for her.

**Scenes 12/13: Family arriving to winery + ambushing random private citizens and giving them free wine**

* Producers say Kris is most comfortable with her age. At times, she can be the most youthful person in the room despite the age she’s at.
* Once they landed, everyone went straight to the vineyards.
* There were a total of three vineyards on the itinerary for day one.
* They all went shopping up and down one of the main streets, too.
* Producers say no one became emotional or shell-shocked over meeting the family. The crowd in Napa was fun!
* Producers say Khloe and Kris are usually fearless when it comes to accepting dares.
* The girls complimented about four different parties at the vineyard.

**Scene 14: Car ride - Khloe talks freezing eggs / Kim having a phone call about Rodney Reed**

* Kris saw a hardware store that she wanted to go to, but producers could’t get clearance fo film. Producers said the store workers thought they were prank calling them and kept hanging up.
* Producers say everyone in the family turns to Kim for feedback.
* Initially, Khloe worried about how it would be perceived that she was considering freezing embryos with Tristan.
* Kim takes a lot of naps here and there - and will sleep in the car if there’s a long drive.
* Kris gets the most business done in the car.
* Producers say no one win the family gets carsick. But whenever Kylie drives, they’re a little uneasy because they don’t think she’s the best driver.

**Scene 15: Drunk Kris Jenner at its finest**

* Producers say it took a little bit of wrangling to get everyone from one vineyard to the next.
* It doesn’t take much for Kris to get drunk, say producers.

**Scene 16: The girls forced to sit, dance and be merry for the cameras at Corey’s birthday lunch**

* Producers say Kris was really proud of the girls and happy that Corey had such a great time.
* Everyone agrees that Rob is the best dancer in the family.
* Corey had on a “kind of electronic slow-tuned bossanova-type yacht music” for everyone to groove to.
* The girls brought Corey’s favorite cake from L.A. with them on the jet

**Scene 17: Kim in Houston preparing to meet Rodney Reed**

* Kim was calm before going inside to meet Rodney.
* One producer followed Kim into the parking lot but no one was allowed inside the jail except for Kim and her attorneys.

**Scene 18: Khloe before surgery preparing to freeze her eggs**

* Khloe’s mindset the day of the procedure was calm and relaxed.
* Producers say she was looking forward to the process being done.
* Kim and Khloe have the highest tolerance for pain. Kylie is the most squeamish.
* Producers say Khloe’s procedure was quick and easy. She was in and out in a couple of hours.

**Scene 19: Kim tells Khloe how Rodney Reed meeting went / Oreo McFlurry giveaway at McDonalds**

* Kanye and the kids came up to Houston with Kim and met up with her later.
* Producers say all the sisters love a little drive-thru stop.

**Scene 20: Tristan kisses major ass to Khloe over FaceTime**

* Khloe and Tristan FaceTime at least a couple of times per day.
* Both Khloe and Tristan are really good about communicating and making sure Tristan and True see each other via FaceTime while he’s on the road.
* Producers say it’s not awkward to film personal phone calls. It’s their job to be a fly on the wall and follow their personal lives without making them feel uncomfortable.
* Khloe told Tristan over FaceTime that she was pregnant with True. It’s also how she broke the news to Kylie.

ff455o,True Crime Podcast,"Hi All,

Juast wanted to put this out there. I started a True Crime podcast talking to guys who are still in the system as in still in prison. I have talked with Drew Peterson, Steven Hayes, Jesse James Hollywood, Darrick Hernandez, Jeff Garcia and the family of Rodney Reed to mention a few. A lot of these guys will write letters but I actually have them on-air I am actually working on several others including Courtenay Savage and Martin Puccio and a couple of guys in Federal Prison as well. Anyways - the podcast is here: [anchor.fm/joseph-tomaso5](https://anchor.fm/joseph-tomaso5) if anyone would like to listen. Also comments, suggestions and if there's anyone you'd like me to try and interview, let me know at: [insidetherazorwire@gmail.com](mailto:insidetherazorwire@gmail.com). I'm working on trying to get Chris Watts and Ted Kaczynski and Eric Rudoulph. I tried to see if the surviving Boston Bomber still has it out for the U.S. but the BOP says he still too high profile to speak to anyone other than a few approved people. My actual goal for the show is to show people that Prison isn't what you see on shows like Lock Up and 60 Days In but also to get some of these guys to say that they actually feel remorse and actually try to get them to tell young people what prison is really all about and that they don't want to wind up on the wrong side of those walls.

Anyways, take a read, take a listen and let me know what you think.

I understand there's no doubt he killed his victim, unlike in the Rodney Reed execution, and that would make a public argument much less compelling, but he is clearly a changed man and I can't really stomach that he's about to die. It just seems so cruel.
