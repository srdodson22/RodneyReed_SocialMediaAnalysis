1fksfnj,me0xdas,KyleButtersy2k,"Reed has been tried and had everyone of his 12 appeals labeled as ""abuse of the appellate court system"".

He does have the Innocence Project working for him, so there is a whiteboard somewhere in their offices with another 20 years of appeals planned.

Facts are: 

Reed never knew Stacey until the day he raped and murdered her. While there have been lots of people that the IP has produced to tell a story of how they didn't say anything about their knowledge about a ""relationship"" back in the 90's but they just ""had"" to come forward in the 2020s to tell their story of connecting Stacey and Rodney, none of those stories were deemed believable to the judge ruling on the case. They have exhausted their legal argument that Rodney and Stacey has a relationship.

Reed at one point demanded that two beer cans found near the site of the body be analyzed, after rudimentary testing showed in might be similar to dna of others involved with the case.  Once full.testing of those cans were done, the dna actually matched zero people involved with the case and were deemed to have nothing to do with the crime. Rodney' IP team stopped barking up that tree. 

Similar to the beer cans, now there is a demand to test the belt of Stacey's that she was strangled with. Even though the belt was treated after the murder  as evidence, that could not be tested for dna because ""touch dna"" was not possible in the 90s and early 00s. That means many people, like the jury, the lawyers, and all others who might handle evidence, have put their dna on the belt.  Likely the dna that was on there 20 plus years ago no longer is.  But that is what the IP is now demanding to be tested.  It's a safe bet for them to delay the execution because if it IS tested, and Jimmy Fennels dna is on it (as he lived with Stacey and likely could have touched the belt)  they will demand that his dna makes him the murderer. If it is tested and Rodney's dna is on it, they will just fall back to their pretend relationship being the reason his dna is there.  If it is an unidentified DNA on the belt, they will demand that a third party is involved and Rodney is innocent. 

There will be something after this that the IP files to delay it further.  Thanks to people like the original poster of this post you keep low info folks thinking that something sinister is keeping Reed locked up.  Meanwhile he raped many woman, was caught raping and murdering one woman and is exactly where he needs to be until final.judgement is exacted.",1,1740160305.0,False,https://reddit.com/r/creeptimethepodcast/comments/1fksfnj/rodney_reed/me0xdas/,t3_1fksfnj,0

1f1swi2,ll9ls24,ssp92,"Make no mistake. Reed is highly likely guilty.

a) Reed’s DNA was in found in multiple places. At trial, the jury was aware of intact spermatozoa DNA in the victim, as well as saliva DNA on her chest – further confirmed by tests performed by the defense’s own expert, Dr. Johnson.“Dr. Johnson's DQ–Alpha testing on the saliva from breast swabs taken by Blakley yielded the same results as the previous testing conducted by DPS. On the swab taken from Stacey's left breast, testing indicated 1.2, 4.1, and 3 alleles, and on the swab taken from Stacey right breast, testing indicated 1.2, 3, and 4.1 alleles. Dr. Johnson conceded that in all of the sixteen sites tested in this case, Reed could not be excluded as the donor of the semen and saliva found on Stacey's body.” \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587\_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf) - page 122a\]“Dr. Johnson identified the substance as saliva based on an amylase test. Amylase is a primary component of saliva, according to Dr. Johnson. Dr. Johnson stated that it was likely that the saliva got there after Stacey's last shower, which was the night before she was murdered.” \[[https://law.justia.com/cases/texas/court-of-criminal-appeals/2008/17748.html](https://law.justia.com/cases/texas/court-of-criminal-appeals/2008/17748.html) \]

b) New testing done in 2014 also showed Reed’s DNA from touch mixed with the victim’s on her back-brace found in the truck, as well as her pants.  \[[https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808\_99b68a76d3144c4faac8375a404f376d.pdf](https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808_99b68a76d3144c4faac8375a404f376d.pdf) - page 11\]“Reed also could not be excluded, using Y-STR analysis, from three vaginal swabs, a rectal swab, Stites’s panties, vaginalswab sticks, a vaginal sperm-search slide, and extracts of stains found on Stites’s back brace, pants, and a breast swab.

1f1swi2,llgqiaf,KyleButtersy2k,"Reed's execution was not delayed because of Dr. Phil, although Phil did do a 2 part show on it in which he asked Reed, ""Did you kill Stacey Stites"" after which Reed said, ""I did not"" and without much more than that, Phil, likely on orders from Oprah, said he believed him.

In other interviews, Rodney can't even tell you where he was when the state supposes she was killed.

Many pretend that there was internal corruption because her fiance was a policeman and ten full years after his fiance was murdered,  he got put to jail for sexual assault. But the investigation was done by Texas Rangers and wasn't investigated at all by the police force at which the fiance worked.

Reed was convicted by a jury and has had 25 years of appeals. Judges have described most of his appeals as an abuse of the appeals system.

The Innocence Project is good at prolonging the life of death row inmates but Rodney Reed will never get out of jail because his crimes are obvious and his defense is an abuse of the justice system.",1,1725456932.0,False,https://reddit.com/r/creeptimethepodcast/comments/1f1swi2/rodney_reed_high_priority/llgqiaf/,t3_1f1swi2,0

1f1swi2,ll9lsug,ssp92,"Then there the circumstantial evidence against Reed:

c) Reed lied about not knowing Stacey Stites initially. Then came up with the secret affair defense at trial in 1998, only after being presented with the DNA evidence. \[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587\_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf - page 207a\] The excuse that he was afraid of admitting to the interracial relationship in small-town racist Bastrop, holds no water, seeing as in 1996, Reed had already had two children with Lucy Eipper, also a white woman. \[https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808\_88cb22cd079e4d3f8c9c6e9c5dccf1ae.pdf - page 20\] He also cannot account for his whereabouts on the night of the murder.

d) Reed's story about the last time he saw Stacey keeps changing. In 1998, he claimed the last time he saw her was a few days prior to her death. Then in 2001 it was a day and a half. From 2014 onwards he claimed it was roughly 24 hours prior to her death. \[https://static.texastribune.org/media/files/66b09bb6ee402879ad65d6b22232446f/Rodney-Reed-ruling.pdf - page 35\]

e) Tests of Jimmy Fennell’s truck, where the prosecution theorizes part of the attack took place, found that a person around 6 feet, 2 was the last driver of the vehicle based on the height of the seat in relation to the mirrors. Reed is 6 feet, 2. \[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587\_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf - page 4a-5a, 26a, [https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808\_ff1ce06e53b44745b718717fae875c2b.pdf](https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808_ff1ce06e53b44745b718717fae875c2b.pdf) - page 43\]

f) Jimmy Fennell’s Truck was found in the Bastrop High School parking lot, about sixth-tenths of a mile, approximately a 15-minute walk, from Reed’s residence at the time of the murder, and in close proximity to the train tracks that Reed often frequented. \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587\_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf - page 116a, 207a\]](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf)",1,1725343922.0,False,https://reddit.com/r/creeptimethepodcast/comments/1f1swi2/rodney_reed_high_priority/ll9lsug/,t1_ll9ls24,1
1f1swi2,ll9ltqd,ssp92,"g) Police often saw Reed on the route Stites would drive for work, in the early hours of the morning. One officer testified that it would be a regular occurrence for him to see Reed in 1995-1997, between 9:00pm and 3:00am in the area. \[[https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/50\_reporters-record\_jury-trial-guilt-innocence-afternoon-session\_volume-50-of-69.pdf](https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/50_reporters-record_jury-trial-guilt-innocence-afternoon-session_volume-50-of-69.pdf) - page 70\]

h) Unbeknownst to the Jury at trial, Reed became a suspect under very incriminating circumstances. About 6 months after the Stites murder; a woman named Linda Schluter went to police after a tall black man tried to sexually assault her and stole her car, at around 3am in Bastrop. \[[https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808\_26423e4169d34d57b5daba08aca49852.pdf](https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808_26423e4169d34d57b5daba08aca49852.pdf) - page 44-47\] Based on her description of the perpetrator, as well the area the attack took place, where police had often seen Reed in those early hours, they zeroed in on Reed and Schlueter picked him out of a photo lineup. Because of the similarities with the Stites case police thought Reed a likely suspect: in addition to the attack taking place around the same time and area, Schlueter’s vehicle was also dumped in close proximity to Reed’s residence. \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/45899/20180507150103836\_Reed%20BIO%20FINAL.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/45899/20180507150103836_Reed%20BIO%20FINAL.pdf) - page 5, 8\] It was at this time law enforcement thought to match the DNA found in the Stites murder with Reed. Reed did not become a suspect in the Stites case until late February, early march of 1997, further complicating the allegations of a planned railroading. \[[https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/46\_reporters-record\_jury-trial-guilt-innocence-phase-afternoon-session\_volume-46-of-69.pdf](https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/46_reporters-record_jury-trial-guilt-innocence-phase-afternoon-session_volume-46-of-69.pdf) - page 122\]",1,1725343936.0,False,https://reddit.com/r/creeptimethepodcast/comments/1f1swi2/rodney_reed_high_priority/ll9ltqd/,t1_ll9lsug,2

Reed, 56, has been on death row for more than 25 years after being convicted of Stites' murder. He has maintained his innocence, with his legal team arguing that new evidence points to Stites' fiancé as the real killer.

In June 2023, the state's highest criminal court ruled that Reed had not demonstrated he was more likely than not innocent of Stites' murder, despite new evidence presented by his attorneys.

Reed's legal team from the Innocence Project has previously argued that prosecutors withheld crucial evidence that could have exonerated Reed during his original trial.

The remaining claims are the request to file the successive habeas claims pending before the 5th Circuit and the 5th Circuit's review of the dismissal of Reed's 1983 claim challenging denial of his DNA testing requests in state court.

Meanwhile Rodney Reed was on trial for rape before he graduated high school and did time in jail for beating a young girl who accused him of raping her (it should not be surprising that he was not convicted of rape in the 1980s long before the public adopted the ""believe women "" mantra).

Later...

His mentally challenged girlfriend also brought charges against him for anal rape.

His baby momma brought charges against him for raping her on the very bed that their baby son was on.

His dna matched the rape kit of a woman who was raped on the railroad tracks near where rodney often hung out.

His dna matched a young rape victim who never saw her assailant.

Reed was identified as the man who, after asking a woman for a ride home, beat and attempted to rape that woman.  This happens to fit the modus operandi of how Stites might have been abducted and is what led police to accuse and arrest Reed 6 months after the murder.

There is overwhelming evidence that Reed is properly convicted for the crime.

There have been appeals and hearings in which Reeds lawyers have presented people who, decades later, testify about a romance and connection between Reed and Stites.

If you haven't read the transcripts of the trial in which these ""rodney and stacey romance"" witnesses testify, you should if you are going to defend a murderer.  Needless to say, the judge was not impressed that these witnesses popped up in 2019 when their testimony about the murder would have garnered them with $30,000 reward money back 20 years ago.

The Innocence Project is willing to endorse these liars because a cornerstone of their mission is to do away with the death penalty in the states that still have it.

There is NO PROOF that Reed had ever encountered Stacey one on one before he raped and murdered her.

There is testimony from people that the Innocence Project arranged to talk about rumors or vague sightings across parking lots or confessions from Stacey to a girl she didn't really know about her affair.  All of which was found to be unconvincing in a court of law.  These people who supposedly stayed silent when she was murdered even with a $30,000 bounty on evidence by HEB couldn't get them to speak up.

Was Stacey raped? Yes, of course, she was raped before or during her murder.  The defense highlights that the coroner can not determine if sex was rough and consensual or rough and non-consensual.  

However, the state in which she was found can be used to determine this.  The sperm found on and in her body, and the clothing ripped and taken from her body suggest strongly that she was raped.

The theory that the husband set the scene is less than credible when his ability to get from their home, to the place the body was found, and back home was not something that could be accomplished.

I will say that according to Stacey's mother, Stacey's cousin is, in fact, having wahoo fun helping Reed.  Also Stobbs hadn't seen Stacey in over a decade.

>Law enforcement isn't coming forward to support Reed, cause wahoo, this is so much fun.

>Jimmy didn't confess to murdering Stacy, cause wahoo

>The original state forensic experts didn't come forward to help Reed, cause wahoo

They didn't help Reed.  The IP likes to say they reversed their testimony.  But Bayardo simply said that he didn't think his testimony should be used to confirm exact time of death.  But his original testimony heard by the original jury was never anything but an estimate. So that went nowhere to help Reed.

>Why don't you mention that the # of people Reed's attorneys brought in to testify to a Reed / Stiles relationship was 17? Not 1. Not 2. 17.

If they brought 117 they would still have to pass a level of legitimacy.  But the IP has raised millions of dollars fundraising around Reed so they can afford to bring 1117 witnesses.

>Why don't you mention that the cops knew from the very beginning that Stiles had another boyfriend?

Her name is Stites. 

>Why don't you mention that all these people who came forward weren't sought out by the original detectives?

All HEB employees were appraised of their need to help finding Stacey's killer. The 'people who came forward' decades after the murder were all found not convincing.

>Why can you spout all this ""evidence"" about Reed committing other sexual assaults, but don't mention all the sexual assaults Fennel was accused of? 

Tell us of all you know about all the sexual assaults Fennell was accused of.  I know he was jailed for one.  Unsure about other rumors.  I just know about what has been legally adjudicated. 

>Why don't you point out the the ONLY person ever convicted of a sexual assault is Stacy's ""fiance"", Jimmy Fennel?

Reed was convicted of raping and murdering Stacey Stites.

>Why don't you point out that the major point is contention is the refusal of the court to test the murder weapon for DNA. If you're so sure of Reed's guilt, then why not support the test? Why are you afraid?

1d1hmte,m4j1src,Inevitable-Ad-4579,"I honestly do not think that this case should ever have even been brought to trial. This was a clear show of how the criminal justice system says you are guilty and good luck proving your innocence (especially if there is extreme amount of media coverage before the trial <not talking about the show ‘accused’ because obviously that is after> but also if you are a person of color,). I believe that the district attorney’s office just wanted to convict someone confirmation bias be damned and how easy was it for them to even do… not? Obviously this family had money so they had to do something right away because if this had been done in an area where the median income was much lower things would not have happened this fast and after the second missed trial, how was there? No plea offered that was a clear sign to me. Something fishy was going on. The fact that they could arrest him 15 minutes after arriving on scene when processing the scene took hours and hours would to a person with sound mind and basic logic that the confirmation bias was already in place and fax did not matter. Unfortunately, this case was never gonna end I anything but a guilty verdict and that the district attorney’s office was going to keep trying it until they got their way. The worst part about this entire thing in my opinion, obviously besides a travesty of someone who we don’t know whether or not they were guilty or innocent being incarcerated after seven years, and three separate trials) is the fact that the poor parents, the victims of this horrific crime are not even at the forefront. I’d bet money that most of the jury could not even tell you what the victims names were. Well, let me correct myself. They couldn’t tell you the name of AJ’s mother and the only reason they know the father’s name is because AJ was named after him. This entire case was built on nothing but cops who wanted to get this done as quick as possible, and the fact that they had someone right in front of them who was there good enough. No forensics will make them up later if we have to. If you have to build a case on the fact that a security system that usually works worked, but there were also a few glitches, but don’t worry about those, and we aren’t gonna even bring up any ‘real evidence’ until the final trial. I mean this jury was so dense as to think that that shirt had not been tested this whole entire time until right before the third trial. I guess whatever you need to sleep at night right? The fact that the person who found the flakes under the sticker clearly stated that the box had flakes of blood all over the bottom all over the box and admitted that it was just as possible that it came from cross. Contamination should’ve been enough to not even allow that witness on the stand. How can you bring someone up as an expert to say my expert opinion is there’s no other way these flakes could’ve gotten there and then the defense show you a box with all the flakes and you say oh yeah that could happen too. I just feel like I could go on and on about how none of us know what happened that night yet someone is spending the rest of their life in jail.

As I stated at the beginning, do I know beyond a reasonable doubt who committed this crime no and not a single person can honestly say that they do… if you think you can prove to me behind a reasonable doubt that Josh wasn’t already in the home when the alarm was set or that you can put the murder weapon in someone’s hand or how about the fact that his sister who was in the home for sure says it wasn’t him says that his account matches her after seven years you don’t think things would start to change? His story and her story have been the same because they are giving the truth while someone with mental health issues did a gunshot residue test but refused to say where they were but the officers at the scene decided it was more than enough to just arrest AJ and not look into anyone else? Any good detective would say that it is arguably more important to rule people out then confirm your own thoughts to rule them in. I mean it’s Texas. What can you expect? I’m honestly surprised you didn’t get the death penalty and that’s only because he was a minor at the time… 

Watching the show has just opened my eyes even more you how terrifying and disturbingly unjust our system really is. I don’t understand how a single member of that jury can sleep at night and I hope every time they close their eyes they think about that child who lost their parents while they were in the home and that they can’t know for sure if he really did it or not, but just to get it over with they put them in jail. How can a single jury member be OK knowing that they don’t know if the person sitting in jail right now actually did it or if they just let someone get away with a double homicide… I truly believe that they were told in someway or another do not come out until you have a verdict And if it’s not guilty, they’ll be held to pay. Can I prove that beyond a reasonable doubt neither can anyone else to use guilty and I guess that’s good enough…

Again, please someone prove to me on a reasonable doubt that AJ Armstrong committed this crime. I would love to see that because right now all I have is doubt and it seems like everybody else does too in any other case when you have not one, but two miss trials a plea would have been put on the table a long time ago… how did that not happen even once? In my opinion, the only thing that I have no reasonable doubt about is that this kid was railroaded from the beginning and nobody knows what happened in that house, but that the district attorney‘s office would rather say they won and be able to say they know what a face of a killer looks like then actually find the killer And had no problem. Bending any rule cutting any corner and at the end of the day tarnishing the already Shawty criminal justice system in this country and especially the system in Texas that already lock up people of color before they’ve even got the crime scene text at the property… oh the other thing I have no reasonable doubt about his I bet that DA got a nice bonus at the end. 

TLDR this entire trial could not be a better example of confirmation bias, racism, and the fact that our system says you are guilty unless we decide to allow you to prove your innocence and putting your faith in a jury of “your people” is clearly the worst system we could’ve come up with, and something needs to be done.

He had been going about pursuing his hobby of committing a series of rapes against young women while having a consensual relationship with the girlfriend of a cop in a neighboring town; a relationship that both had kept hidden from everyone.  The bad luck came when one day, after they had had consensual sex, the cop/boyfriend decided to murder the girl and stage it to look like one of the rapes Rodney really committed.  It was particularly bad luck for poor Rodney that the cop/boyfriend just happened to dump the girlfriend’s car near Rodney’s home.  When it was discovered that the DNA on the girlfriend’s body matched the DNA on the other rape victims, the police suspected the perpetrator was the same.  Talk about jumping to conclusions.  When the DNA was linked to Rodney, he was toast; even when he denied ever meeting the victim.

After his conviction, Rodney finally came clean about his relationship with the victim, plenty of well meaning civilians who only wanted Social Justice believed poor Rodney.  It was only members of Law Enforcement and judges who didn’t. And, this wasn’t the first time Rodney found himself in this situation.

This is how police eventually solved this crime:

>On Nov. 9, 1996, 19-year-old Austin native Linda Schlueter was visiting friends in Bastrop when she stopped to use a drive-up payphone at the now-closed Long’s Star Mart on Loop 150, also known as Chestnut Street, in Bastrop.

>She said she was using the drive-up payphone through her car window when a tall black man approached her, asking for a ride. Initially, she said she refused.

>""He was on the phone with somebody else, and he said, ‘She won't give me a ride, I guess I'll just freeze to death.’ And it made me feel bad. I was only 19 at the time,” Schlueter told KVUE.

>“So, I was like, ‘Where do you live?’ And he said, ‘On Main Street,’ and in my mind, Main Street is this big, lit up road,” Schlueter said. “So, I was like, ‘How far?’ And he said, ‘A mile or two.’”

>He got in her car, and she said as she started driving down the street it started to get darker. She said when he pointed down a dark road to turn, she refused and tried to turn the car back around.

>She said when he went to get out of the car, he attacked her.

>""The next thing I know he has me by the back of my hair slamming my face in my steering wheel,” Schlueter said. “I'm punching backward, and I open the door. I scream so loud that I peed my pants, and I just kept punching.""

>Schlueter said she kept trying to fight back as he continued to attack her.

>""And I asked him, ‘What do you want? What the hell do you want from me?’ And he said, ‘I want a blowjob,’” said Schlueter. “And I said, ‘You'll have to kill me before you get anything from me.’ And he said, ‘I guess I have to kill you then.’""

>Schlueter said he tried to take her in her car, but when she saw other car lights approaching, she jumped out and ran. She said the man took off in her car, and she found help and called 911.

>""The cops came, and I identified who it was, exactly what he was wearing, where I picked him up, what time it was,” said Schlueter.

>According to prosecutors, earlier in the night, a Bastrop police officer had noticed Reed – a man who had been arrested several times in Bastrop before – hanging around Long’s Star Mart. 

>When officers got a description of Schlueter’s attacker, they realized he matched the description of Reed that night, including what he was wearing. 

>""I knew immediately who it was. Immediately. I picked him out immediately, no doubt at all,” said Schlueter. 

>This attack is what would lead police to connect Reed to Stacey Stites' case. 

There's really no great mystery as to what happened here. The Long Star Mart was on Stites's way to work. Sounds like Schlueter got pretty lucky to have escaped; she was about to be killed the exact same way Stites was killed.

14vijx2,jrkerdb,oscar_the_couch,"> We appear to be at the point where I would start asking the Reed's attorney what he thinks should happen next.

I think that's absolutely wild. Reed didn't come forward with his version of events (i.e., that he had consensual sex with her the previous night, late April 21 early April 22) until after consulting with his own DNA experts about what forensic scenario might have been plausible. According to Reed's forensic experts, the murder happened sometime before midnight the morning of April 23 (a theory he advanced after putting forward a witness who, not very credibly, claimed to have seen Fennell and Stites arguing at around 5AM). *Somehow*, Fennell's truck made it the 30 or so miles to the high school and Fennell made it back to the apartment without the truck. (Police checked cab services—and none in the area had a record of driving anyone around that time between those areas.) How that happened is just one of life's mysteries.

Reed's version of events isn't consistent with the testimony of the victim's own mother, who lived in the apartment below and to the right of Stacey. She was up until 1:30 AM the evening of Stites's murder and didn't hear or see anything that would implicate Fennell. It's a bit hard to imagine such a quiet murder under the circumstances. It's also a bit hard to imagine that Stacey goes an entire day without taking a shower after allegedly having sex with Reed late April 21. Really? She doesn't take a single shower that would wash the saliva off her chest? Come on.

>My name is Carol Stites, I am 55 years of age. My date of birth is 12-27-41. I am the mother of Stacey Stites. On Monday 4/22/96, I was in my apartment at the Rolling Oaks Apartment in Giddings. I think it was apartment 503. I lived in the apartment below and to the right of Stacey. She lived upstairs with her fiancee, Jimmy Fennell.

>Stacey and Jimmy became very close while we were in Bastrop. Jimmy moved in with us in October. Jimmy got a job in Giddings as a police officer. In December, Jimmy got an apartment in Giddings. Jimmy asked her to marry him but he was talked out of it by his mother. Stacey and I moved into the same apartment complex the first of January 1996. Jimmy gave Stacey a ring and she moved in with him in February. They were planning a March wedding, but his mother talked him out of that so they were planning a wedding on May 11, 1996.

>On Monday 4-22-96, I was at my apartment when Stacey came in from work at about 1:30. She was driving Jimmy's truck. Jimmy was at work. Stacey came directly into my apartment and we talked for a few minutes. Stacey left and went upstairs to change out of her work clothes. She was wearing her blue pants and white shirt. I'm thinking she had the red work shirt in her hand. She wasn't gone very long, just long enough to change, and then she came back downstairs. Stacey fixed herself a meatloaf sandwich and ate. She wrapped up in a throw I had and laid down on the couch and went to sleep.

>Stacey came back down to my apartment about 7:30. I was crying and Stacey asked me what was wrong. I told her I was stressed out over the wedding, that things weren't going the way we thought they were. I told Stacey she should think twice about this marriage. I told her she needed to really make up her mind about whether she wanted a mother in law messing in her business. Jimmy's mother wouldn't call me about anything, she would go through Jimmy which was creating problems between Jimmy and Stacey. Stacey told me she loved both me and Jimmy and I was just going to have to learn how to get along with Jimmy's mom. 

>I saw Jimmy through the window walking around the end of the building. Stacey asked me if I had seen Jmuny and I told her yeah, that he had just walked around the end of the building. I assumed he was going to David's because that's the direction he was going. Stacey went out the apartment and around the end of the building where he had gone. Stacey came back running and was laughing like she had pulled something on him. He was chasing her, and he was laughing. They ran upstairs. It was probably a little after 8 o'clock. That was the last time I saw her.

>**I stayed in my apartment the entire evening and watched TV. I stayed up until about 1:30 AM Tuesday morning. I never heard anything unusual. I drifted off to sleep one time, for about 30 minutes. I got up and went to bed.** I woke up out of a sleep about 5:15 that morning. I had the feeling somebody was telling me I had done a good job of raising Stacey. I remember thinking my job wasn't over yet.

Notable in Reed's affidavit is also what it *doesn't* say. He doesn't say what he was doing that night or where he was. He doesn't say he doesn't remember where he was. There's zero effort whatsoever to establish an alibi for that evening or explain the absence of an alibi. He just doesn't say where he was at all. There's an obvious strategic reason for this: should any other witness come forward and say they actually saw him at X or Y place, suddenly he can remember something consistent with that. But if he comes forward *now*, that possibility is unavailable. 

I disagree also that he was entitled to test DNA evidence on the belt. There's no guaranty that his DNA will be there if he is guilty, and there's also a reasonable likelihood that Fennell's DNA will be there even if he *didn't* do it. It doesn't help resolve the crime at all. And, even if Reed's DNA *does* show up on the belt, that is also explicable by the theory he is already advancing that he had consensual sex with her the night before (which I'm sure he will ""remember"" handling in the unlucky scenario his DNA is found on the belt). There's no scenario where having the DNA tested sheds any light on these two competing theories. 

And if, for some stupid reason, we're supposed to think that establishing one of these guys is a total shitbag for some reason means they're definitely guilty of this murder, then we can't ignore this either:

>In August 1987, Reed physically and sexually assaulted a nineteen-year-old female
named Connie York. According to York, during the assault, her attacker attempted
to penetrate her anus. When Reed was tried for this offense in 1991, he claimed that
he and York were in a secret relationship and that the sex was consensual. The jury
acquitted Reed of sexual assault.

>In September 1989, while Reed was on bond for the York sexual assault, he
physically and sexually assaulted the pseudonymous complainant, A.W., a twelveyear-old girl. DNA testing showed that Reed could not be excluded as the person
who deposited semen in A.W.’s vagina. Photographs corroborated A.W.’s claim
that her attacker repeatedly beat her and bit her face during the encounter. According
to A.W., during the assault, her attacker penetrated her anus and restricted her
breathing.

>In September 1991, Reed physically and sexually assaulted the mother of his
children, Lucy Eipper Gibbs (“Eipper”). Eipper testified that, on another occasion,
Reed penetrated her anus without her consent.

>In May 1995, Reed sexually assaulted his mentally handicapped girlfriend, Carolyn
Rivas. Rivas asserted that Reed held a pillow over her face and penetrated her anus
without her consent. A SANE examination revealed abrasions around Rivas’s anus
consistent with “anal rape.”

>In October 1995, Reed sexually assaulted a woman named Vivian Harbottle
underneath a train trestle in Bastrop. DNA testing showed that Reed could not be
excluded as the person who deposited semen in Harbottle’s vagina.

>In November 1996, in Bastrop, Reed physically assaulted, and attempted to sexually
assault, a nineteen-year-old female named Linda Schlueter. The evidence showed
that Schlueter’s attacker used her car to flee the scene

Please pardon me if I don't think we should be asking Reed's attorney what should happen next. This dude had a history of raping strangers—including children—and ejaculating inside them, claiming secret relationships with his victims, and using the victim's own cars to flee the scene. If you want to bring in that sort of ""character evidence"" as we try to resolve his guilt or innocence, it's not exactly exculpatory for him.

It's no wonder Texas wants to execute this guy if no other verdict is ever final. I don't really favor the death penalty, but these aggressive efforts to set free someone who almost certainly killed this girl are awful.

I will give Mr. Reed this, though. His trial went *terribly* for him, and he probably could have put on a stronger (though still losing) defense if he had marshaled all of these other witnesses at his trial. If your lawyer ever says this in closing, that's a pretty good sign you're fucked:

>The State's attorney, for some
strange reason, has implied to you that I had
a contract with you. Ladies and gentlemen, I
have been a lawyer too long to enter into a
contract that I didn't know I was entering
into. What I told you in opening argument is
what I say I think the evidence will show. It
was the State's attorney who decided that they
wanted to enter into a contract with you. Do

0. We should focus instead on why Rodney Reed lied to begin with. That's where we would find answers and we haven't done that.

1. Someone is trying to convince me and I'm not connected in any way to the case, the defendant or anyone.

2. It is too easy to find these things that either 2a) are fabrications created by Jimmy Fennell or 2b) are people connecting too many dots to Jimmy Fennell. 

>Linda Schlueter, a former good friend of Jimmy Fennell, also had quite a lot of run ins with the law. It’s reported she entertained several Judges and Politicians in Austin and Bastrop during her career as an exotic dancer. Why did she lie about Rodney Reed?

14vijx2,l3fznub,XenaBard,"Four other women were also sexually assaulted by Reed, one of whom was 12 years old at the time. Is she also lying? It is ridiculous to claim that Fennell put all of them up to it.   What’s more likely is that BOTH Fennell and Reed are dirtbags.  Even if Fennell raped a woman that doesn’t mean that Reed did not rape all 5! Reed is either was the most unlucky man on the face of the earth,  OR he is a serial offender.  Ever hear of Occam’s razor?  

In the past, Reed got away with rape by claiming he & his victim had a consensual relationship. The defense has two options: either claim the DNA was planted (or contaminated) or claim that the victim & he had consensual sex. Since the latter worked in the past, why not use it again? 

You have no CLUE how shameful it is to come forward to report being sexually assaulted. Even worse, testifying in an open courtroom!  Then, the defense attorney came as close as she could to implying that Schleuter was a whore.  Be grateful that you have no idea what that feels like. 

Only 30% of sexual assaults are reported because the process is so traumatizing. That leaves 70% of victims who refuse to voluntarily subject themselves to this, regardless of whether they are “good friends” or not.  You have no idea unless you have been in their shoes.

I don't have a supposition.  What I see reported by multiple sources is more of an actual accusation than some supposition.

>How much of her story do you think was invented?

Again - not me.   There are times that using the word ""you"" is fine - like when explaining some procedure like - when someone is walking ""you look both ways when you cross the street."" That's instructional.

Even so it can be said without using te word ""you."" But here the word is used as an accusation -as if someone would have to believe that all of someone else's story is ""invented"" even though there are people involved in this case - and more than one who have suggested that there are serious flaws in what she stated.  

So I see 2 issues: first using the word ""you"" not in an example or instructional way and second, pretending that I would have to think something is ""all made up.""  

What I will do is check further into her statements and to see what it is that the IP is trying to say. I do see the point where it seems tying Rodney Reed to the rape of Schlueter requires a bit more information. 

What I see is a lot of ""you, you.""  And a lot of asking directed at me.

>Did Vivian Harbottle also lie about Reed raping her?

So I'm being asked.


>How much of her story do you think was invented?

And again.

>Schlueter said she kept trying to fight back as he continued to attack her.

I am looking for evidence that ""he"" refers to Rodney Reed - at all.  And what I see are a lot of people who tend to doubt that.

14v9byl,k7j1qr7,LOBrienC-C,"The problem is that at the time Stacey was murdered, police had no evidence that she was having an affair with anyone, black or white.  They looked for an affair, as they believed that to be Fennell's motive for killing her.  Not one co-worker reported this alleged affair to investigators.  No one in her family reported this alleged affair to investigators.  Even after Reed was arrested, no one came forward to corroborate his claim of an affair.  Two weak witnesses were presented at trial.  One claimed that she saw Reed talking to Stacey in the HEB (or walking out holding hands - it's been a while) and the other used the name Stephanie, instead of Stacey.  She claimed a white girl came looking for Reed at his mother's house in a truck that didn't match Fennell's truck.  Their testimony, because it was weak, was rejected by the jury.

Reed's mother and brother, who claimed to have known Stacey did not testify and have never testified.  The reality is that the claimed affair never happened.  No one has provided irrefutable and/or corroborated evidence of it.  The time to do that was at trial.

Fennell was the prime suspect for about 8-10 months after Stacey's murder.  He only ceased to be the suspect when Reed was linked to Stacy's murder by the DNA inside and on her body, as well as in her panties.

Again, the witnesses that have come forward didn't report any of this information to police at the time Stacey was murdered in 1996.  They didn't report it when Reed was arrested in 1997, or when he was on trial in 1998.  They didn't come forward during his post-conviction hearings in 2001 or 2006.  A few of them came out of the woodwork in 2014/2015.  The majority didn't come out of the woodwork until 2021 when Reed faced an execution date.

None of these witness statements have refuted the DNA.  Reed's claims about time of death have also fallen short of the evidentiary hurdles, given that, yet again, the time to challenge the ME was at trial, not in 2014 when Reed is facing execution, or again in 2021 when he's facing execution.

The courts have heard the evidence presented by Reed.  They have found it to be exaggerated and failing to stand up to scrutiny.

14ldt1g,jpvh198,texastribune,"The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has denied Rodney Reed a chance for a new trial, nearly four years after halting his execution and ordering the trial court to weigh whether Reed might be innocent in the 1996 murder of Stacey Stites.

In a 129-page ruling, Texas’ highest criminal court delivered a crushing blow to Reed, who has been on Texas’ death row for more than a quarter-century. The 55-year-old’s case gained international attention as his execution neared in 2019, with a new swell of supporters doubting his guilt in 19-year-old Stites’ murder and calling for his life to be spared.

Despite the ruling, Reed likely won’t face an immediate execution date. The U.S. Supreme Court in April sided with Reed in another appeal, opening the door for him to pursue DNA testing on evidence used to convict him.

Reed has long proclaimed his innocence, and his supporters hoped he would get a new trial after the Court of Criminal Appeals stopped his execution in 2019. His lawyers over the years have brought forward a mountain of new evidence and witnesses who they say show Reed’s innocence and instead casts suspicion on Stites’ fiance, Jimmy Fennell.

Both men have been accused of multiple sexual assaults. Reed was indicted, but never convicted, in several other rape cases. Fennell spent 10 years in prison after he kidnapped and allegedly raped a woman while on duty as a police officer in 2007.",12,1687969155.0,True,https://reddit.com/r/politics/comments/14ldt1g/texas_appeals_court_rejects_death_row_inmate/jpvh198/,t3_14ldt1g,0

14ldt1g,jpz4e5t,ssp92,"Make no mistake. Reed is highly likely guilty.

a) Reed’s DNA was in found in multiple places. At trial, the jury was aware of intact spermatozoa DNA in the victim, as well as saliva DNA on her chest – further confirmed by tests performed by the defense’s own expert, Dr. Johnson.“Dr. Johnson's DQ–Alpha testing on the saliva from breast swabs taken by Blakley yielded the same results as the previous testing conducted by DPS. On the swab taken from Stacey's left breast, testing indicated 1.2, 4.1, and 3 alleles, and on the swab taken from Stacey right breast, testing indicated 1.2, 3, and 4.1 alleles. Dr. Johnson conceded that in all of the sixteen sites tested in this case, Reed could not be excluded as the donor of the semen and saliva found on Stacey's body.” \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587\_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf) \- page 122a\]“Dr. Johnson identified the substance as saliva based on an amylase test. Amylase is a primary component of saliva, according to Dr. Johnson. Dr. Johnson stated that it was likely that the saliva got there after Stacey's last shower, which was the night before she was murdered.” \[[https://law.justia.com/cases/texas/court-of-criminal-appeals/2008/17748.html](https://law.justia.com/cases/texas/court-of-criminal-appeals/2008/17748.html) \]

b) New testing done in 2014 also showed Reed’s DNA from touch mixed with the victim’s on her back-brace found in the truck, as well as her pants. A fact The Intercept fails to mention for some reason... \[[https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808\_99b68a76d3144c4faac8375a404f376d.pdf](https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808_99b68a76d3144c4faac8375a404f376d.pdf) \- page 11\]“Reed also could not be excluded, using Y-STR analysis, from three vaginal swabs, a rectal swab, Stites’s panties, vaginalswab sticks, a vaginal sperm-search slide, and extracts of stains found on Stites’s back brace, pants, and a breast swab. Suppl.CR(DNA).53. This additional testing demonstrated that DNA profiles consistent with Reed’s were in even more locations than what the jury knew about—Stites’s back brace (found in the truck) and her pants (she was wearing).”\[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/45899/20180507150103836\_Reed%20BIO%20FINAL.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/45899/20180507150103836_Reed%20BIO%20FINAL.pdf) \- page 13\]

Then there the circumstantial evidence against Reed:

c) Reed lied about not knowing Stacey Stites initially. Then came up with the secret affair defense at trial in 1998, only after being presented with the DNA evidence. \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587\_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf) \- page 207a\] The excuse that he was afraid of admitting to the interracial relationship in small-town racist Bastrop, holds no water, seeing as in 1996, Reed had already had two children with Lucy Eipper, also a white woman. \[[https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808\_88cb22cd079e4d3f8c9c6e9c5dccf1ae.pdf](https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808_88cb22cd079e4d3f8c9c6e9c5dccf1ae.pdf) \- page 20\] He also cannot account for his whereabouts on the night of the murder.

d) Reed's story about the last time he saw Stacey keeps changing. In 1998, he claimed the last time he saw her was a few days prior to her death. Then in 2001 it was a day and a half. From 2014 onwards he claimed it was roughly 24 hours prior to her death. \[[https://static.texastribune.org/media/files/66b09bb6ee402879ad65d6b22232446f/Rodney-Reed-ruling.pdf](https://static.texastribune.org/media/files/66b09bb6ee402879ad65d6b22232446f/Rodney-Reed-ruling.pdf) \- page 35\]

e) Tests of Jimmy Fennell’s truck, where the prosecution theorizes part of the attack took place, found that a person around 6 feet, 2 was the last driver of the vehicle based on the height of the seat in relation to the mirrors. Reed is 6 feet, 2. \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587\_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf) \- page 4a-5a, 26a, [https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808\_ff1ce06e53b44745b718717fae875c2b.pdf](https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808_ff1ce06e53b44745b718717fae875c2b.pdf) \- page 43\]

f) Jimmy Fennell’s Truck was found in the Bastrop High School parking lot, about sixth-tenths of a mile, approximately a 15-minute walk, from Reed’s residence at the time of the murder, and in close proximity to the train tracks that Reed often frequented. \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587\_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf) \- page 116a, 207a\]

g) Police often saw Reed on the route Stites would drive for work, in the early hours of the morning. One officer testified that it would be a regular occurrence for him to see Reed in 1995-1997, between 9:00pm and 3:00am in the area. \[[https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/50\_reporters-record\_jury-trial-guilt-innocence-afternoon-session\_volume-50-of-69.pdf](https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/50_reporters-record_jury-trial-guilt-innocence-afternoon-session_volume-50-of-69.pdf) \- page 70\]

h) Unbeknownst to the Jury at trial, Reed became a suspect under very incriminating circumstances. About 6 months after the Stites murder; a woman named Linda Schluter went to police after a tall black man tried to sexually assault her and stole her car, at around 3am in Bastrop. \[[https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808\_26423e4169d34d57b5daba08aca49852.pdf](https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808_26423e4169d34d57b5daba08aca49852.pdf) \- page 44-47\] Based on her description of the perpetrator, as well the area the attack took place, where police had often seen Reed in those early hours, they zeroed in on Reed and Schlueter picked him out of a photo lineup. Because of the similarities with the Stites case police thought Reed a likely suspect: in addition to the attack taking place around the same time and area, Schlueter’s vehicle was also dumped in close proximity to Reed’s residence. \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/45899/20180507150103836\_Reed%20BIO%20FINAL.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/45899/20180507150103836_Reed%20BIO%20FINAL.pdf) \- page 5, 8\] It was at this time law enforcement thought to match the DNA found in the Stites murder with Reed. Reed did not become a suspect in the Stites case until late February, early march of 1997, further complicating the allegations of a planned railroading. \[[https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/46\_reporters-record\_jury-trial-guilt-innocence-phase-afternoon-session\_volume-46-of-69.pdf](https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/46_reporters-record_jury-trial-guilt-innocence-phase-afternoon-session_volume-46-of-69.pdf) \- page 122\]",3,1688033638.0,False,https://reddit.com/r/politics/comments/14ldt1g/texas_appeals_court_rejects_death_row_inmate/jpz4e5t/,t3_14ldt1g,0

Some points of clarification:

Rodney Reed's defense of why his DNA was found on Stacey Stite's body is that they were in a secret relationship and the sex was consensual. This is the same defense he used at his trial for Connie York's rape.

Lucy Eipper Gibbs testified during the punishment phase of his trial for the rape/murder of Stacey Stites. Be forewarned her testimony is extremely graphic and brutal. \[[https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808\_88cb22cd079e4d3f8c9c6e9c5dccf1ae.pdf](https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808_88cb22cd079e4d3f8c9c6e9c5dccf1ae.pdf)\]

Now that the murder case is in jeapordy, this rapist could walk away a free man despite raping 4 women.

Prosecutors did the rape victims a major injustice by not prosecuting him with those crimes when they had the chance.  Even if his death penalty is revoked at least we could get him for life in prison on rape.

That this country spends too much money on prisoners and if you got a trial fair or not you were convicted. A reason to get the wealthy to not pay taxes. Secret is they don't pay the majority of taxes if any with the tax breaks for jobs and other tax avoidance. But the oligarchs in this country appealed to the working class in this country and convinced them that the justice system is fair and everyone gets a fair shake. And anyone who say different is soft on crime. Then they vote in the tough on crime guy who's really there for the tax breaks. But now you have a budget deficit. Guess what gets cut.

1338zyz,jiabxl3,Rotdevil,"From above, sorry for the wall of text but this shit is insane;
The murder weapon has never been tested for DNA evidence. Requests for DNA testing of crime scene evidence, including of a belt that was used as the murder weapon, have been repeatedly denied by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. And the United States Supreme Court declined to directly review the Texas courts’ denial of DNA testing in 2018.
The State’s forensic experts have admitted to errors in their testimonies, which led to Rodney’s conviction and death sentence.
 State witnesses from Rodney’s original trial have since submitted affidavits stating that testimony given related to Stacey’s time of death was inaccurate, making the prosecution’s timeline of Rodney allegedly killing her implausible.
Rodney Reed and Stacey Stites were having a consensual sexual relationship. At the time of the trial, no one came forward to corroborate their relationship. But today, new witnesses including Stacey’s own cousin and co-worker have corroborated Rodney’s claim that they knew that he and Stacey were romantically involved.
Renowned forensic pathologists have concluded that Rodney’s guilt is medically and scientifically impossible. The prosecution’s only forensic evidence linking Rodney to the crime was semen taken from Stacey’s body, which was attributed to the consensual relationship between them. The prosecution used this to connect him to the murder and refute their consensual romantic relationship, but the testimony supporting this theory has since been recanted, completely discrediting the State’s case.
For months after the murder, Jimmy Fennell, Stacey’s fiancé, was the prime suspect in the case. A recording of one of the police investigators indicates that Jimmy was suspected in Stacey’s murder, and he was believed to be motivated by her relationship with another man.
Jimmy’s best friend at the time of the crime, Bastrop Sheriff’s Officer Curtis Davis, has now revealed that Jimmy gave an inconsistent account of where he was on the night of the murder. Jimmy had told his friend he was out drinking on the night Stacey was murdered. But he later stated he was with Stacey in the apartment they shared during what we now know was the actual time of her death, based on Dr. Michael Baden’s updated testimony, which contradicts his initial claim. When asked to explain this discrepancy, Jimmy declined to testify because his answers might further incriminate him.
Two witnesses have recently come forward and submitted signed affidavits that add to the mounting evidence against Jimmy Fennell. These affidavits include testimony from an insurance salesperson who stated that Jimmy threatened to kill Stacey while applying for life insurance. The second witness was a Deputy in the Lee County Sheriff’s Office at the time of the murder to whom Jimmy made an alarming and incriminating statement regarding Stacey’s body at her funeral.
Jimmy later served a 10-year prison term for a sex crime and kidnapping he committed while on duty. Law enforcement records also document a pattern of violence against women perpetrated by Jimmy.
This case was racially charged. Rodney, a Black man, was found guilty of murdering Stacey, a white woman, by an all-white jury.
A confession by Jimmy Fennell has come to light. On Oct. 29, 2019 Arthur Snow, a former member of the Aryan Brotherhood and Jimmy’s prison mate, disclosed that Jimmy had confessed to murdering Stacey stating, “I had to kill my n*****-loving fiancée,” in a conversation.",56,1682846817.0,False,https://reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1338zyz/supreme_court_lets_rodney_reed_a_texas_death_row/jiabxl3/,t1_ji968mf,1

1338zyz,jibferl,NoKindofHero,"> From above, sorry for the wall of text but this shit is insane; 

* The murder weapon has never been tested for DNA evidence. 

* Requests for DNA testing of crime scene evidence, including of a belt that was used as the murder weapon, have been repeatedly denied by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals and the United States Supreme Court declined to directly review the Texas courts’ denial of DNA testing in 2018. 

* The State’s forensic experts have admitted to errors in their testimonies, which led to Rodney’s conviction and death sentence.

* State witnesses from Rodney’s original trial have since submitted affidavits stating that testimony given related to Stacey’s time of death was inaccurate, making the prosecution’s timeline of Rodney allegedly killing her implausible.
*  Rodney Reed and Stacey Stites were having a consensual sexual relationship. At the time of the trial, no one came forward to corroborate their relationship. But today, new witnesses including Stacey’s own cousin and co-worker have corroborated Rodney’s claim that they knew that he and Stacey were romantically involved. 
* Renowned forensic pathologists have concluded that Rodney’s guilt is medically and scientifically impossible. The prosecution’s only forensic evidence linking Rodney to the crime was semen taken from Stacey’s body, which was attributed to the consensual relationship between them. The prosecution used this to connect him to the murder and refute their consensual romantic relationship, but the testimony supporting this theory has since been recanted, completely discrediting the State’s case. 
* For months after the murder, Jimmy Fennell, Stacey’s fiancé, was the prime suspect in the case. A recording of one of the police investigators indicates that Jimmy was suspected in Stacey’s murder, and he was believed to be motivated by her relationship with another man. Jimmy’s best friend at the time of the crime, Bastrop Sheriff’s Officer Curtis Davis, has now revealed that Jimmy gave an inconsistent account of where he was on the night of the murder. Jimmy had told his friend he was out drinking on the night Stacey was murdered. But he later stated he was with Stacey in the apartment they shared during what we now know was the actual time of her death, based on Dr. Michael Baden’s updated testimony, which contradicts his initial claim. When asked to explain this discrepancy, Jimmy declined to testify because his answers might further incriminate him. 
* Two witnesses have recently come forward and submitted signed affidavits that add to the mounting evidence against Jimmy Fennell. These affidavits include testimony from an insurance salesperson who stated that Jimmy threatened to kill Stacey while applying for life insurance. The second witness was a Deputy in the Lee County Sheriff’s Office at the time of the murder to whom Jimmy made an alarming and incriminating statement regarding Stacey’s body at her funeral. Jimmy later served a 10-year prison term for a sex crime and kidnapping he committed while on duty. Law enforcement records also document a pattern of violence against women perpetrated by Jimmy.
*  This case was racially charged. Rodney, a Black man, was found guilty of murdering Stacey, a white woman, by an all-white jury. 
* A confession by Jimmy Fennell has come to light. On Oct. 29, 2019 Arthur Snow, a former member of the Aryan Brotherhood and Jimmy’s prison mate, disclosed that Jimmy had confessed to murdering Stacey stating, “I had to kill my n*****-loving fiancée,” in a conversation.",10,1682869568.0,False,https://reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1338zyz/supreme_court_lets_rodney_reed_a_texas_death_row/jibferl/,t1_jiabxl3,2

They are very selective in which cases they look at and pick up.

But you are correct that someone else’s DNA doesn’t mean the crime didn’t occur.  I knew of a guy that was absolutely guilty of 3 sexual assaults but got exonerated. When he was arrested and charged with those offenses a detective charged him with some additional cases that didn’t meet his MO, victim type, area etc. because he was under pressure to clear cases. They examined the DNA from one of those cases and it proved he didn’t commit that one offense so he went free even though he was guilty of the original 3 cases. Also a serial rapist was walking free and continuing to commit crimes while this guy sat in jail. 

The guy went on to continue being a piece of shit human being but the Dallas Co DA was nervous about filing any cases against him due to the appearance of retaliation (he got a monthly check from the county as part of his settlement and he would lose it upon another conviction. DA’s reputations hinge on conviction rates so they were understandably gun shy about proceeding with user level drug possession cases).

They are well respected because they attract very competent lawyers. It doesn't mean the clients they take on aren't guilty. 

This is how police eventually solved this crime:

>On Nov. 9, 1996, 19-year-old Austin native Linda Schlueter was visiting friends in Bastrop when she stopped to use a drive-up payphone at the now-closed Long’s Star Mart on Loop 150, also known as Chestnut Street, in Bastrop.

>She said she was using the drive-up payphone through her car window when a tall black man approached her, asking for a ride. Initially, she said she refused.

>""He was on the phone with somebody else, and he said, ‘She won't give me a ride, I guess I'll just freeze to death.’ And it made me feel bad. I was only 19 at the time,” Schlueter told KVUE.

>“So, I was like, ‘Where do you live?’ And he said, ‘On Main Street,’ and in my mind, Main Street is this big, lit up road,” Schlueter said. “So, I was like, ‘How far?’ And he said, ‘A mile or two.’”

>He got in her car, and she said as she started driving down the street it started to get darker. She said when he pointed down a dark road to turn, she refused and tried to turn the car back around.

>She said when he went to get out of the car, he attacked her.

>""The next thing I know he has me by the back of my hair slamming my face in my steering wheel,” Schlueter said. “I'm punching backward, and I open the door. I scream so loud that I peed my pants, and I just kept punching.""

>Schlueter said she kept trying to fight back as he continued to attack her.

>""And I asked him, ‘What do you want? What the hell do you want from me?’ And he said, ‘I want a blowjob,’” said Schlueter. “And I said, ‘You'll have to kill me before you get anything from me.’ And he said, ‘I guess I have to kill you then.’""

>Schlueter said he tried to take her in her car, but when she saw other car lights approaching, she jumped out and ran. She said the man took off in her car, and she found help and called 911.

>""The cops came, and I identified who it was, exactly what he was wearing, where I picked him up, what time it was,” said Schlueter.

>According to prosecutors, earlier in the night, a Bastrop police officer had noticed Reed – a man who had been arrested several times in Bastrop before – hanging around Long’s Star Mart. 

>When officers got a description of Schlueter’s attacker, they realized he matched the description of Reed that night, including what he was wearing. 

>""I knew immediately who it was. Immediately. I picked him out immediately, no doubt at all,” said Schlueter. 

>This attack is what would lead police to connect Reed to Stacey Stites' case. 

There's really no great mystery as to what happened here. The Long Star Mart was on Stites's way to work. Sounds like Schlueter got pretty lucky to have escaped; she was about to be killed the exact same way Stites was killed.

I agree with you, though I wouldn't go as far as to say that there is no way that society can tolerate such dissonance, considering that it's been doing so for quite a while.

But look at war. That's sanctioned killing, but psychologists have found that the values dissonance between society and the army exacerbates PTSD. There is a difference between Vietnam and Korea, for example.

And on another note, the historian Will and Ariel Durant once wrote that the evolution of morality has not been a change in the rules so much as a widening in the scope of application of those rules.

Fennel later served time in prison for kidnapping and sexually assaulting a woman while on duty as a police officer. At his trial, a pattern of violence against women was shown. 

One of Fennel’s cell mates has come forward saying that Fennel confessed to killing  his “n*****-loving fiancé.”  

Also, the State’s expert witnesses have come forward and said they gave an inaccurate time of death estimate.

The 5th Circuit raised a timeliness issue related to the filing of the underlying claim and that is the claim that was presented to the U.S. Supreme Court.  

When the Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the trial court's denial of testing in 2017, Reed took a writ to the U.S. Supreme Court, which denied review.

12s363v,jgy20r1,sammytheammonite,"Let’s not forget - the belt WAS DNA tested and the results are part of the official record. The DNA test that Reed is asking for is a TOUCH dna test. Good luck showing that a touch DNA test is stronger evidence than the DNA tests they have already conducted and that were used to convict. Semen in her vagina and anus. Semen in her panties that she put on for work that morning. DNA on her work pants that she put on that morning. DNA on her work back brace, found in her truck. Saliva DNA found on her body (breast area) AFTER her shower prior to leaving for work. ALL of that DNA matched only one person - Reed. Testing a belt 27 years after the fact for touch DNA isn’t going to alter the stronger DNA evidence, or what it means.

Let’s also not forget that in the 11 months between her death and Reed’s arrest not a SINGLE person came forward saying she had a relationship with Reed. No one. Nada. He was only connected to Reed because he raped another woman and when his DNA was placed into the system, it matched the cases of 4 other women, including one child. All with similar MOs to stacy’s abduction and rape. 

Let’s also not forget, that after his arrest, ge denied knowing her - until presented with the DNA match. Then his story changed. Then he claimed they had a secret relationship. Not because her fiancée was a cop or because she was engaged. He didn’t know that. But because she was white and he black and the town was racist so they had to hide it. The same town where he regularly dated white women, openly. And had kids with a white woman. Let’s also not forget that he used THIS EXACT SAME DEFENSE in another trial where he beat and raped a woman. Secret relationship. She was white. Racism. Funny how the only secret relationships with whites women were those in which he was accused of hurting them. Weird.

He denied knowing her during interviews and at the trial changed his statement to say they were good friends and having an affair. None of her friends remember ever seeing Rodney Reed at all.

He raped her and killed her.

The rape and murder of Stites was hardly Reed’s first or last foray against women. First was Connie York, a nineteen-year-old who had come home late one evening after swimming with friends. 57.RR.34–35. York was grabbed from behind and told “don’t scream or I’ll hurt you.” 57.RR.35–36. When York did not listen, she was repeatedly struck, dragged to her bedroom, and raped multiple times. 57.RR.37–42.

Reed was interviewed, and, while he admitted that he knew York from high school, he denied raping her. 57.RR.123–24. When confronted with a search warrant for biological samples, Reed had an about-face, “Yeah, I had sex with her, she wanted it.” 57.RR.138. The case went to trial four years later, 57.RR.30, 60, and Reed was acquitted, 57.RR.61.

Next was A.W., a twelve-year-old girl, who was home alone, having fallen asleep on a couch after watching TV. 58.RR.36–42. A.W. awoke when someone began pushing her face into the couch and had blindfolded and gagged her. 58.RR.42–43. She was repeatedly hit in the head, called vulgar names, and orally, vaginally, and anally raped. 58.RR.43–49. The foreign DNA from A.W.’s rape kit was compared to Reed; Reed was not excluded and only one in 5.5 billion people would have the same foreign DNA profile from A.W.’s rape kit. 58.RR.51, 92;61.RR.26.

Then came Lucy Eipper, who Reed had met in high school, and whom Reed began to date after her graduation. 59.RR.10–12. Eipper had two children with Reed. 59.RR.13–14, 19–20 Throughout their relationship, Reed physically abused Eipper, including while she was pregnant, and raped her “all the time,” including one time in front of their two children. 59.RR.14–17, 21, 25–32.Afterwards, Reed began dating Caroline Rivas, an intellectually disabled woman. 60.RR.39–41. Rivas’s caseworker noticed bruises on Rivas’s body and, when asked about them, Rivas admitted that Reed would hurt her if she would not have sex with him. 60.RR.41, 61.Later, Rivas’s caseworker noticed that Rivas was walking oddly and sat down gingerly. 60.RR.43. Rivas admitted that Reed had, the prior evening, hit her, called her vulgar names, and anally raped her. 60.RR.44, 63–65. The samples from Rivas’s rape kit provided the link to Stites’s murder. 60.RR.89–90.Shortly thereafter, and about six months before Stites’s murder, Reed raped Vivian Harbottle underneath a train trestle as she was walking home. 59.RR.87–92. When she pleaded for her life for the sake of her children, Reed laughed at her. 59.RR.94. The foreign DNA from Harbottle’s rape kit Awas compared to Reed; he could not be excluded, and only one person in 5.5 billion would be expected to have the same foreign DNA profile. 59.RR.95, 113–14; 61.RR.26.

Finally, and about six months after Stites’s murder, Reed convinced nineteen-year-old Linda Schlueter to give him a ride home at about 3:30 a.m. 61.RR.10, 37–47. Reed led her to a remote area and then attacked her. 61.RR.47–58. After a prolonged struggle, Schlueter asked Reed what he wanted and Reed responded, “I want a blow job.” 61.RR.60. When Schlueter told Reed that “you will have to kill me before you get anything,” Reed stated “I guess I’ll have to kill you then.” 61.RR.60. Before Schlueter could be raped, a car drove by and Reed fled. 61.RR.62–64. “

The majority held that the SOL began to run when the state appellate court denied the plaintiff’s motion for a rehearing, ending the state litigation. The Fifth Circuit below had held that the SOL started running when the state trial court denied Reed’s petition, and was thus expired by the time he filed a section 1983 suit in federal court.

Makes sense, hard to argue denial of due process when that process is not over yet.

12ruo86,jh1x736,Houstonearler,"Borrowed from another redditor:

I’m late to the party, but here’s my thoughts (copied from a previous write up of mine):
  

  
There is no new evidence in the Reed case. A couple people coming forward after TWENTY YEARS of silence isn’t valid evidence. The defense that it was consensual was presented at his original trial, and the jury didn’t find it viable. He has NEVER testified at trial about a consensual relationship.
  

  
What we do know, and what has already been presented to the courts:
  

  
Stacey was wearing her HEB shirt, work shoes, work pants and name tag when she was abducted, raped and murdered. This highly suggests she was abducted on her way to work that morning. They found semen in her underwear that was bunched by her hips. That semen matched Reed. They also found semen in her vagina. Matched Reed. They found saliva DNA on her chest - also matched Reed (wouldn’t survive a shower). In 2014, the pants she was wearing - her work pants, were tested. DNA matched Reed. This places him near the body on the day she died. They also tested the back brace in her truck. DNA on that also matched Reed - placing him near the Truck when she died.
  

  
Stacey was strangled and sodomized. Reed has a history of violence and rape (victims testified at his trial and his DNA was a match to three other open rape cases with similar MOs). That history included strangling his victims with belts or articles of clothing and sodomizing them, including a 12 year old girl, who had Reed’s DNA inside her vagina.
  

  
Stacey had bruises on her arm consistent with being held forcibly. Trauma on her head consistent with knuckles. Injuries to her anus consistent with sodomy. Her HEB shirt was ripped off her body. He underwear with semen in them was bunched at her hips. Her work pants were forcibly removed, breaking the zipper. One work shoe was found by her body, the other in the truck. All of this suggests rape and murder the morning she left for work. Her own mother heard her leave for work that morning, and testified to this effect and had never waivers from her account.
  

  
The truck was left at Bastrop High School after dumping her body. This is over 30 miles away from Stacey’s house and only walking distance from Reed’s home. He was known to walk in that area and even picked up other victims near this same area. The seat was set at a position consistent with Reed’s height. Not Stacey’s. And not Jimmy’s. The seat belt was still fastened, suggesting that Stacey was pulled from the driver’s seat forcibly.
  

  
The beer cans were tested by his own defense team and they ruled out Hall, Selmena and Stacey as contributors. The idea that the beer cans weren’t tested is not true. The idea that these two cops were a match is not true. This is a false narrative perpetuated by Reed’s supporters.
  

  
In the time between Stacey’s death and Reed’s arrest (11 months), his name never came up as a boyfriend, friend or acquaintance. Not once. Not by anyone at all. When Reed was first questioned, he denied knowing her. Over and over again. It was only after he was presented with the DNA evidence that he changes his story and claimed a secret sexual relationship. The only other time he claimed this was in a separate rape case 10 years prior - used the same excise as his defense. However, he consistently dated white women, openly. Never in secret. Never hidden. The mother of his children is white. The only time he claimed secret relationships because of racial tensions was when he was accused of rape. Twice.
  

  
I don’t know how you can hear this evidence in full and think anyone other than Reed is responsible for this crime.

12ruo86,jh1xd59,Houstonearler,"Here is a summary of the trial testimony from Reed’s punishments phase:
  

  

  
The rape and murder of Stites was hardly Reed’s first or last foray against women. First was Connie York, a nineteen-year-old who had come home late one evening after swimming with friends. 57.RR.34–35. York was grabbed from behind and told “don’t scream or I’ll hurt you.” 57.RR.35–36. When York did not listen, she was repeatedly struck, dragged to her bedroom, and raped multiple times. 57.RR.37–42.

When confronted with a search warrant for biological samples, Reed had an about-face, “Yeah, I had sex with her, she wanted it.” 57.RR.138. The case went to trial four years later, 57.RR.30, 60, and Reed was acquitted, 57.RR.61.
  

  

  
Next was A.W., a twelve-year-old girl, who was home alone, having fallen asleep on a couch after watching TV. 58.RR.36–42. A.W. awoke when someone began pushing her face into the couch and had blindfolded and gagged her. 58.RR.42–43. She was repeatedly hit in the head, called vulgar names, and orally, vaginally, and anally raped. 58.RR.43–49. The foreign DNA from A.W.’s rape kit was compared to Reed; Reed was not excluded and only one in 5.5 billion people would have the same foreign DNA profile from A.W.’s rape kit. 58.RR.51, 92; 61.RR.26.
  

  

  
Then came Lucy Eipper, who Reed had met in high school, and whom Reed began to date after her graduation. 59.RR.10–12. Eipper had two children with Reed. 59.RR.13–14, 19–20 Throughout their relationship, Reed physically abused Eipper, including while she was pregnant, and raped her “all the time,” including one time in front of their two children. 59.RR.14–17, 21, 25–32.
  

  

  
Afterwards, Reed began dating Caroline Rivas, an intellectually disabled woman. 60.RR.39–41. Rivas’s caseworker noticed bruises on Rivas’s body and, when asked about them, Rivas admitted that Reed would hurt her if she would not have sex with him. 60.RR.41, 61.Later, Rivas’s caseworker noticed that Rivas was walking oddly and sat down gingerly. 60.RR.43. Rivas admitted that Reed had, the prior evening, hit her, called her vulgar names, and anally raped her. 60.RR.44, 63–65. The samples from Rivas’s rape kit provided the link to Stites’s murder. 60.RR.89–90.
  

  

  
Shortly thereafter, and about six months before Stites’s murder, Reed raped Vivian Harbottle underneath a train trestle as she was walking home. 59.RR.87–92. When she pleaded for her life for the sake of her children, Reed laughed at her. 59.RR.94. The foreign DNA from Harbottle’s rape kit was compared to Reed; he could not be excluded, and only one person in 5.5 billion would be expected to have the same foreign DNA profile. 59.RR.95, 113–14; 61.RR.26.
  

  

  
Finally, and about six months after Stites’s murder, Reed convinced nineteen-year-old Linda Schlueter to give him a ride home at about 3:30 a.m. 61.RR.10, 37–47. Reed led her to a remote area and then attacked her. 61.RR.47–58. After a prolonged struggle, Schlueter asked Reed what he wanted and Reed responded, “I want a blow job.” 61.RR.60. When Schlueter told Reed that “you will have to kill me before you get anything,” Reed stated “I guess I’ll have to kill you then.” 61.RR.60. Before Schlueter could be raped, a car drove by and Reed fled. 61.RR.62–64.

12ruhrk,jgwisnx,ROSRS,">KAVANAUGH, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS, C. J., and SOTOMAYOR, KAGAN, BARRETT, and JACKSON, JJ., joined.

Odd split  


>Reed’s action should be dismissed for lack of subjectmatter jurisdiction. Federal district courts lack appellate  
jurisdiction to review state-court judgments, and Reed’s action presents no original Article III case or controversy between him and the district attorney. Because the Court erroneously holds that the District Court had jurisdiction  
over Reed’s action, I respectfully dissent.   
................  
>  
>Properly understood, therefore, Article III, the Rooker Feldman doctrine, and procedural due process principles work in harmony. The majority’s piecemeal analysis replaces this natural coherence with chaos. It dilutes Article III’s traceability and redressability requirements to the point of irrelevance. It creates a system in which the same state-court actions simultaneously give rise to identical original and appellate claims for relief. See this Court’s Rule 13.3 (“\[T\]he time to file \[a\] petition for a writ of certiorari . . . runs from the date of the denial of rehearing” by the lower court). It allows Reed to convert his failed certiorari petition into a §1983 complaint. And, in doing so, it authorizes a proceeding in which the District Court can do nothing except opine on the constitutional merits of a state-court adjudication.

**a)** Reed’s DNA was in found in multiple places. At trial, the jury was aware of intact spermatozoa DNA in the victim, as well as saliva DNA on her chest – further confirmed by tests performed by the defense’s own expert, Dr. Johnson.

“Dr. Johnson's DQ–Alpha testing on the saliva from breast swabs taken by Blakley yielded the same results as the previous testing conducted by DPS. On the swab taken from Stacey's left breast, testing indicated 1.2, 4.1, and 3 alleles, and on the swab taken from Stacey right breast, testing indicated 1.2, 3, and 4.1 alleles. Dr. Johnson conceded that in all of the sixteen sites tested in this case, Reed could not be excluded as the donor of the semen and saliva found on Stacey's body.” \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587\_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf) \- page 122a\]

“Dr. Johnson identified the substance as saliva based on an amylase test. Amylase is a primary component of saliva, according to Dr. Johnson. Dr. Johnson stated that it was likely that the saliva got there after Stacey's last shower, which was the night before she was murdered.” \[[https://law.justia.com/cases/texas/court-of-criminal-appeals/2008/17748.html](https://law.justia.com/cases/texas/court-of-criminal-appeals/2008/17748.html) \]

**b)** New testing done in 2014 also showed Reed’s DNA from touch mixed with the victim’s on her back-brace found in the truck, as well as her pants. A fact The Intercept fails to mention for some reason... \[[https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808\_99b68a76d3144c4faac8375a404f376d.pdf](https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808_99b68a76d3144c4faac8375a404f376d.pdf) \- page 11\]

“Reed also could not be excluded, using Y-STR analysis, from three vaginal swabs, a rectal swab, Stites’s panties, vaginalswab sticks, a vaginal sperm-search slide, and extracts of stains found on Stites’s back brace, pants, and a breast swab. Suppl.CR(DNA).53. This additional testing demonstrated that DNA profiles consistent with Reed’s were in even more locations than what the jury knew about—Stites’s back brace (found in the truck) and her pants (she was wearing).”

\[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/45899/20180507150103836\_Reed%20BIO%20FINAL.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/45899/20180507150103836_Reed%20BIO%20FINAL.pdf) \- page 13\]

Then there the circumstantial evidence against Reed:

**c)** Reed lied about not knowing Stacey Stites initially. Then came up with the secret affair defense at trial in 1998, only after being presented with the DNA evidence. \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587\_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf) \- page 207a\] The excuse that he was afraid of admitting to the interracial relationship in small-town racist Bastrop, holds no water, seeing as in 1996, Reed had already had two children with Lucy Eipper, also a white woman. \[[https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808\_88cb22cd079e4d3f8c9c6e9c5dccf1ae.pdf](https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808_88cb22cd079e4d3f8c9c6e9c5dccf1ae.pdf) \- page 20\] He also cannot account for his whereabouts on the night of the murder.

**d)** Reed´ s story about the last time he saw Stacey keeps changing. In 1998 he claimed the last time he saw her was a few days prior to her death. Then in 2001 it was a day and a half. From 2014 onwards he claimed it was roughly 24 hours prior to her death. \[[https://static.texastribune.org/media/files/66b09bb6ee402879ad65d6b22232446f/Rodney-Reed-ruling.pdf](https://static.texastribune.org/media/files/66b09bb6ee402879ad65d6b22232446f/Rodney-Reed-ruling.pdf) \- page 35\]

**e)** Tests of Jimmy Fennell’s truck, where the prosecution theorizes part of the attack took place, found that a person around 6 feet, 2 was the last driver of the vehicle based on the height of the seat in relation to the mirrors. Reed is 6 feet, 2. \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587\_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf) \- page 4a-5a, 26a, [https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808\_ff1ce06e53b44745b718717fae875c2b.pdf](https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808_ff1ce06e53b44745b718717fae875c2b.pdf) \- page 43\]

**f)** Jimmy Fennell’s Truck was found in the Bastrop High School parking lot, about sixth-tenths of a mile, approximately a 15-minute walk, from Reed’s residence at the time of the murder, and in close proximity to the train tracks that Reed often frequented. \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587\_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf) \- page 116a, 207a\]

**g)** Police often saw Reed on the route Stites would drive for work, in the early hours of the morning. One officer testified that it would be a regular occurrence for him to see Reed in 1995-1997, between 9:00pm and 3:00am in the area. \[[https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/50\_reporters-record\_jury-trial-guilt-innocence-afternoon-session\_volume-50-of-69.pdf](https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/50_reporters-record_jury-trial-guilt-innocence-afternoon-session_volume-50-of-69.pdf) \- page 70\]

**h)** Unbeknownst to the Jury at trial, Reed became a suspect under very incriminating circumstances. About 6 months after the Stites murder; a woman named Linda Schluter went to police after a tall black man tried to sexually assault her and stole her car, at around 3am in Bastrop. \[[https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808\_26423e4169d34d57b5daba08aca49852.pdf](https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808_26423e4169d34d57b5daba08aca49852.pdf) \- page 44-47\] Based on her description of the perpetrator, as well the area the attack took place, where police had often seen Reed in those early hours, they zeroed in on Reed and Schlueter picked him out of a photo lineup. Because of the similarities with the Stites case police thought Reed a likely suspect: in addition to the attack taking place around the same time and area, Schlueter’s vehicle was also dumped in close proximity to Reed’s residence. \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/45899/20180507150103836\_Reed%20BIO%20FINAL.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/45899/20180507150103836_Reed%20BIO%20FINAL.pdf) \- page 5, 8\] It was at this time law enforcement thought to match the DNA found in the Stites murder with Reed. Reed did not become a suspect in the Stites case until late February, early march of 1997, further complicating the allegations of a planned railroading. \[[https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/46\_reporters-record\_jury-trial-guilt-innocence-phase-afternoon-session\_volume-46-of-69.pdf](https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/46_reporters-record_jury-trial-guilt-innocence-phase-afternoon-session_volume-46-of-69.pdf) \- page 122\]",4,1665505247.0,False,https://reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/y0qp7g/texas_claims_its_too_late_for_dna_testing_that/irwmqae/,t3_y0qp7g,0

y0qp7g,irw08n8,skillfire87,"Rodney Reed has gotten way more attention than he deserves (as the rapist of a 12 year old girl).

y0qp7g,irtsz3k,dougmc,"> DNA testing shouldn’t take very long.

You've misunderstood the problem here.

The problem isn't that there is not time left to do DNA testing; the problem is that he's already been convicted, so Texas is done with such things and doesn't want to revisit the case.

There are appeals, but the appeals courts look for errors made in the legal process, and ""an innocent man was convicted"" is not the sort of error that the appeals courts really care about; instead, they're after things like evidence that was improperly collected, jurors received improper instructions, stuff like that -- errors made in the legal process.  And in general, ordinary people generally fail in their appeals, but elites have much better luck (in the few cases where they're actually convicted.)

Seriously, Texas's justice system cares way more about the idea that its processes were followed properly than if it has sentenced an innocent person for a crime that they didn't commit, and they have to be dragged, kicking and screaming, to even look at new evidence (or old evidence that was misunderstood or missed) in a case, even if that evidence makes it pretty clear that they convicted an innocent person.

(That said, I also have no special knowledge about *this* case, so I don't know if this evidence really is critical or what, but as far as Texas is concerned, the time for presenting evidence ended when he was found guilty, and it takes a *lot* to convince them otherwise.)",80,1665446498.0,False,https://reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/y0qp7g/texas_claims_its_too_late_for_dna_testing_that/irtsz3k/,t1_irtmg7p,1
y0qp7g,isd4jwp,LOBrienC-C,"DNA testing would not exonerate Reed, who was linked to the murder of Stacey Stites and the rapes of a 12-year old (committed in 1989) and a second woman (committed 6 months before Stacey's murder in 1995).  In Stacey's case, DNA linked to Reed was found in internal swabs, breast swabs and her panties.  In 2014, the prosecution and Reed's counsel agreed to testing outside Texas Chapter 64, which identified additional DNA linked to Reed from swabs of stains taken from Stacey's pants (which were on her body when it was found) and her back brace (which was in the truck when it was found at the Bastrop High School, which was .6-.8 of a mile from the home Reed was living in at the time he killed Stacey).

This is not a case in which the identity of the perpetrator is in doubt.  The perpetrator was identified in 1997, a year after he murdered Stacey.  The reason police had his DNA compared at that time to the unknown DNA from the murder was because he attempted to kidnap and rape another 19-year old woman.  Reed talked that woman into giving him a ride at around 3:00 in the morning.

This is the one who attacked me. The police told me that his name was Rodney Reed.” Reed was arrested, then later released, without posting bond, in connection to Schlueter’s case.

It was -- from a separate, earlier sex assault complaint against Reed. His DNA had been collected and stored in the system, though those charges were ultimately dropped.*

y0qp7g,j85pdl8,KindVillage9325,"That's incorrect Mrs oh Brian, however I've been thinking about your stance and I can see how you are processing the information that is before you and this is what are you are being given and told inevitably processing and communicating outward and there's nothing wrong with that it's not bad to be curious and to believe what you read or to believe that you have read correct data when there might be some changes to that data order that it was completely incorrect to begin with but you and I and the public wouldn't ever know that, that's what this is all about, I won't communicate with you anymore because you continue not tell me what countries laws you follow and how much of the US law you have stored in your brain versus how much US law you've had to deal with on the surface as in Texas it can be very crooked obviously, indeed vacating the conviction would be the best option because all the evidence has been destroyed, the state refusing to test the murder weapon is the red flag to  justice  SotoMayer, I'm glad that she is so direct in her message to the state of Texas and I'm very comfortable now about how things will turn out come the summer, I believe that you do have a clue more than one, so to say that I don't have a clue that's fine because you don't even know what I do for a living or my position in this case I have a feeling that you're not getting paid and it's not your job over the past 25 years to be investigative research on this case and do it right here in Texas, if I could go back to when I picked up the case would I do it again yes but I would do it much differently as I said Rodney is no choir boy but he's no murderer  and the justice is know this, I believe there are a few justices who have the same sentiment that you do toward his behavior prior to Stacee which might include more than one sexual assault, but time has been served on those if he wants to be post convicted as if there was no statute of limitations which there is on that the only charged without a statute is murder of course, I appreciate that you were on here making this a topic to discuss because it's my job to collect data and information on our client and this includes public opinion which I thought Reddit was more of a factually based website when I see that it's more trolling and Rumor than anything but once again how can I expect anybody to have transparency or clarity in regards to this case when there's been so much hidden, so much misinformation and so much time that we don't even know what's real and what's not anymore as far as what actually goes on and what you have said in regards to why they are seeing the case sure that's the real reason, testing of the belt that you say supreme court can't do something, that's not true they can do anything they want and that's what they're doing right now and that's why they can wait and that's why they don't really  have urgency because they would rather pass on expediency to have accuracy and we will hear from the justices lead by Mrs. Sodomeyer this summer sometime and my job will finally be over, that's fine that you can say I don't have a clue I'm not worried about people who try to offend me I would rather be offended then someone produce more false evidence or try to kill a man who has enough reasonable doubt in his corner , killing people isn't the answer and you're heading in the direction of people just like Jimmy and just like they want Rodney to be, a killer, I don't even kill insects and I believe all life matters and killing something does not solve any problems that was thousands of years ago when barbaric activities occurred on a daily basis everybody was at war all the time  in 2023 we don't have to have it that way we didn't have to have it that way in 2003 , I've gotten to know Rodney's family as well , I can see into his mother's eyes, do you have a son Mrs. O'Brien because I do and so does Mrs. Reed, that does not make anything better for Stacee Stites family but that's just part of this agonizing process, I can say that Mrs Stites is not a fan of me but I can also say she's being disrespected across-the-board when it comes down to closure and honesty in regards to her daughters murder, she knows Jimmy did it she doesn't want him in jail he's like her son, Rodney as I said is no choir boy and even his one brother of the four brothers is not necessarily rallying in Rodney's corner because whatever Rodney has done has created his life to be extremely difficult it's not easy having the last name read it down there, I didn't realize racism ran rampant still right here in my backyard but obviously it does and that's why we do have a supreme court and that's why I guess I can kind of tell you're not in America or he would have caught on already not saying that you're clueless but if you're not here on the case like I am  then I would never expect you to have as much of the original information as I do, nobody does there's only a few of us, I was reading when you first posted  way back when how this was a case you just decided to look into  deeper because it interested you and it appears you found the right case because there's nothing like this one, so much convolution and so much smoke and mirrors… Been a long time coming, rapists and murderers don't deserve to be roaming the streets freely, however we shouldn't murder them when we don't even know if they're guilty or not and when it appears that there is something amiss something should be done instead of just trying to kill the man which is what Texas has been doing for the entire time, it really sucks that it took Kim Kardashian to get us to this point but that's what happened and  now it's just a matter of how the Supreme Court decides to correct Texas and how Rodney will be moved toward the freedom and part of my position is to find the number figure that Texas will owe him for his time on death row, guy from South Carolina got 42 million a few years ago after spending 25 years  incarcerated wrongfully, Texas leads the league in false imprisonment and wrongful convictions and it's not a racist thing because there's just as many white guys as there are anybody else in Texas prisons completely innocent, I'm not going to talk to you anymore because you haven't given me any credentials as to your dealings with American law especially Texas, if you were to come back and say that you have dealt with Texas law or you have been to Washington DC and sat in front of justice Sonia Sotomayer  then I would take your word more seriously but in the meantime you're going by what you read which is what is expected, we've not been lied to on a level like this in a long time like they've been doing it so much it reminds me of the Vietnam war when they pull the wool over the eyes of all of the Americans, I hope that justice prevails and if Rodney has to be  guilty I want to see it happen in a real court not a kangaroo Court, they will not be able to take Jimmy to court and he will get away with murder but that's part of the mistakes that were made from the start, Jimmy already spent 10 years in prison and he was on the investigative force for his fiancé's murder back when it happened  so he got to temper evidence and witnesses up to his liking, there are five different police officers or former police officers in that area that helped him but they didn't want to help him they only have to help him because they have small parts in keeping him from going to jail in the first place , it sucks, it all sucks, why am I on the inside of this case, because my ex-wife has known Rodney all her life therefore I know Rodney really well through letters anyway and he's kind of a jerk, very cocky but he does know that he  has news cameras on him and Kim Kardashian visiting him so from that I'm sure he believes that justice will prevail and hopefully it will, actually after Wednesday I know that it will but it's just a matter of how, thank you for opening up the lines of communication and telling me I don't have a clue that's fine, as I said no more Internet trolling between me and you if you have  US law experience then we can keep typing or texting or whatever this is and if you really want to get into this topic my phone number will be left and you can call at any time and we can go from there, in the end it is my son who is 17 and the sweetest boy I'm so lucky  and I want his future to be safe from occurrences like this so I have to

Additionally, as long as Reed remains a convicted rapist and murderer, my commentary is accurate and warranted.  Are you even aware of the DNA evidence linking Reed to Stacey's rape and murder?  There is the DNA inside her body (I won't name the locations, but it's more than one), on her breasts and, as of 2015, on the pants on her body and her back brace.  Based on that DNA, finding no DNA on the belt, unknown DNA on the belt or even Fennell's DNA on the belt will not exonerate Reed, whose conviction is supported by overwhelming DNA evidence.",2,1684364551.0,False,https://reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/y0qp7g/texas_claims_its_too_late_for_dna_testing_that/jkkbq6k/,t1_jjzo71t,7

  The SCOTUS is extremely likely to rule in favor of permitting state legislatures to overrule election outcomes. The likely result of this will be protests and stochastic terrorism upon protestors.

In time, progressive states will become increasingly more defiant of the permanently red U.S. federal government. This will hopefully result in mostly peaceful balkanization of the west coast from the mainland U.S.

This balkanization will likely be peaceful as the red state residents don't want them and are too arrogant to recognize how much of their money comes from them. By the time they realize the financial trouble they are in, the west coast (let's call them Cascadia) will have a solid defense against invasion, making forcible reunion unlikely.

x85ui4,iniscdu,JomaBo6048,"Many people know about MLK's [Letter From Birmingham Jail](https://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html) but few have read. He explicitly calls out so-called moderate clergymen who thought his form of non-violent civil disobedience, i.e. breaking the law on purpose to expose how unjust it was, was too extreme and needlessly provocative:

""My Dear Fellow Clergymen:
While confined here in the Birmingham city jail, I came across your recent statement calling my present activities 'unwise and untimely'...

You deplore the demonstrations taking place in Birmingham. But your statement, I am sorry to say, fails to express a similar concern for the conditions that brought about the demonstrations. I am sure that none of you would want to rest content with the superficial kind of social analysis that deals merely with effects and does not grapple with underlying causes. It is unfortunate that demonstrations are taking place in Birmingham, but it is even more unfortunate that the city's white power structure left the Negro community with no alternative.

In any nonviolent campaign there are four basic steps: collection of the facts to determine whether injustices exist; negotiation; self purification; and direct action. We have gone through all these steps in Birmingham. There can be no gainsaying the fact that racial injustice engulfs this community. Birmingham is probably the most thoroughly segregated city in the United States. Its ugly record of brutality is widely known. Negroes have experienced grossly unjust treatment in the courts. There have been more unsolved bombings of Negro homes and churches in Birmingham than in any other city in the nation. These are the hard, brutal facts of the case. On the basis of these conditions, Negro leaders sought to negotiate with the city fathers. But the latter consistently refused to engage in good faith negotiation.

Then, last September, came the opportunity to talk with leaders of Birmingham's economic community. In the course of the negotiations, certain promises were made by the merchants--for example, to remove the stores' humiliating racial signs. On the basis of these promises, the Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth and the leaders of the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights agreed to a moratorium on all demonstrations. As the weeks and months went by, we realized that we were the victims of a broken promise. A few signs, briefly removed, returned; the others remained. As in so many past experiences, our hopes had been blasted, and the shadow of deep disappointment settled upon us. We had no alternative except to prepare for direct action, whereby we would present our very bodies as a means of laying our case before the conscience of the local and the national community. Mindful of the difficulties involved, we decided to undertake a process of self purification. We began a series of workshops on nonviolence, and we repeatedly asked ourselves: 'Are you able to accept blows without retaliating?' 'Are you able to endure the ordeal of jail?' We decided to schedule our direct action program for the Easter season, realizing that except for Christmas, this is the main shopping period of the year. Knowing that a strong economic-withdrawal program would be the by product of direct action, we felt that this would be the best time to bring pressure to bear on the merchants for the needed change.

...

You may well ask: 'Why direct action? Why sit ins, marches and so forth? Isn't negotiation a better path?' You are quite right in calling for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent resister may sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word 'tension.' I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, so must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood. The purpose of our direct action program is to create a situation so crisis packed that it will inevitably open the door to negotiation. I therefore concur with you in your call for negotiation. Too long has our beloved Southland been bogged down in a tragic effort to live in monologue rather than dialogue.

...

One of the basic points in your statement is that the action that I and my associates have taken in Birmingham is untimely. Some have asked:
'Why didn't you give the new city administration time to act?' The only answer that I can give to this query is that the new Birmingham administration must be prodded about as much as the outgoing one, before it will act. We are sadly mistaken if we feel that the election of Albert Boutwell as mayor will bring the millennium to Birmingham. While Mr. Boutwell is a much more gentle person than Mr. Connor, they are both segregationists, dedicated to maintenance of the status quo. I have hope that Mr. Boutwell will be reasonable enough to see the futility of massive resistance to desegregation. But he will not see this without pressure from devotees of civil rights. My friends, I must say to you that we have not made a single gain in civil rights without determined legal and nonviolent pressure. Lamentably, it is an historical fact that privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily. Individuals may see the moral light and voluntarily give up their unjust posture; but, as Reinhold Niebuhr has reminded us, groups tend to be more You may well ask: ""Why direct action?

People in the rest of the developed democracies did not get all the benefits as citizens they have from purely voting. They joined unions, they went on strike, they occasionally had to fight the police. They also had the ability to imagine that things could get better, something we in the supposedly dynamic and creative US seem to have lost the ability to do because the best we can seem to imagine is that the status quo will get better.

I did provide it, you simply didn't watch it.

Independent State Legislature doctrine is based entirely on one line in Article 1, Section 4, Clause 1 of the constitution

>The times, Place and Manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each state by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators

Which proponents of the doctrine claim gives legislatures ultimate authority on how an election is run in their state, from unconstitutionally gerrymandered maps to swapping out electors in order to appoint who they want as president.

The reality is, the clause simply means the state legislature can choose where and when elections take place, they do *not* have unchecked authority to decide an election or set absurd rules.

The entire reason this made it to the Supreme Court was because the GOP in North Carolina attempted to pass off a highly partisan, gerrymandered map that violated the NC constitution. So the argument being made by the GOP, at the very *least*, is that the state legislature should be able to overrule the *state constitution* when it comes to gerrymandering.

So it's not a matter of ""Would they go that far?"" because we already know the answer to that is a resounding yes. Independent State Legislature doctrine can be used to justify literally any interference or partisan action by the legislature up to and including dismissing the popular vote in that state. That *is* its design and intent.

Again, there is a reason that all the state supreme courts across the country submitted a brief to the SC warning them not to adopt this as it would be disastrous. That's not just ""fear mongering"" that's an overwhelming majority of legal professionals from all manner of backgrounds and persuasions.",2,1662758589.0,False,https://reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/x85ui4/upcoming_supreme_court_cases_that_could_change/ins10i2/,t1_inrrwx2,7
v8fo0j,ibra35v,amador9,"If Rodney is factually innocent, he’s got to be the victim of the worst bad luck coincidence I have ever heard of.

Stacey Stiles was a 19 year old who was living with her cop boyfriend in a town near Bastrop Texas.  She worked in a Bastrop grocery store on a shift that began at 3:30am.  On April 13, 1996, she did not show up for work.  Her car was found in a nearby school parking lot and her boyfriend said she left for work at the normal time.  Later that day her body was found strangled with her belt with indications of rape.  There was spermatozoa in her vagina that was still alive indicating intercourse in the last 24 hours.  DNA test revealed that it did not belong to her boyfriend but it did belong to someone who had commuted a series of unsolved rapes.  The donner turned out to be Rodney Reed.  Reed was arrested and initially denied knowing Stiles.

At trial, Reed did not testify but his lawyer claimed that Rodney and Stiles were having a consensual affair and that his how his DNA got there.  A couple of close relatives backed him up.  He was convicted.

His defenders are now claiming that Stiles was really murdered by her cop boyfriend who, possibly with the help of cop friends, staged her death to look like a rape-murder.  It was just Rodney’s bad luck to having an affair with her and living near where the body was found (well that, and the fact that he had been committing a series of rapes).  Coincidentally, poor Rodney (if you believe this narrative) had earlier been the victim of similar situation.  A woman accused him of rape but he claimed it was consensual sex. The jury hung and charges were dropped.  As lame as this story might seem, there is one fact that does lend a small amount of credibility.  Stiles’ cop boyfriend was, years later, convicted of raping a woman he had in custody.  If he is capable of rape, he could be a murderer as well, I guess.

It seems like a desperate attempt to save a guilty murderer from the death penalty but the claim has picked up a lot of traction on the internet.  Texas Judges aren’t buying it but lots of folks on various on-line sites are lining up to claim this as a case of a Black man being railroaded to death row because he had sex with a White woman.",69,1654797099.0,False,https://reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/v8fo0j/question_regarding_rodney_reed_convicted_of/ibra35v/,t3_v8fo0j,0

v8fo0j,ig40zxc,ssp92,"It is very usual for a person to go back on their initial stance, even if only in its early stages. That takes bravery, and I commend you for it.

Here I´m mostly refering to the comment you made above about LOBrienC-C´s info being incorrect initially.

I´ll be intersted in seing what you dig up, as you go deeper into the rabbit hole.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I myself firmly believe in Reed being guilty, based on the current evidence;

**a)** Reed’s DNA was in found in multiple places. At trial, the jury was aware of intact spermatozoa DNA in the victim, as well as saliva DNA on her chest – further confirmed by tests performed by the defense’s own expert, Dr. Johnson.

“Dr. Johnson's DQ–Alpha testing on the saliva from breast swabs taken by Blakley yielded the same results as the previous testing conducted by DPS. On the swab taken from Stacey's left breast, testing indicated 1.2, 4.1, and 3 alleles, and on the swab taken from Stacey right breast, testing indicated 1.2, 3, and 4.1 alleles. Dr. Johnson conceded that in all of the sixteen sites tested in this case, Reed could not be excluded as the donor of the semen and saliva found on Stacey's body.” \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587\_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf)  \- page 122a\]

“Dr. Johnson identified the substance as saliva based on an amylase test. Amylase is a primary component of saliva, according to Dr. Johnson. Dr. Johnson stated that it was likely that the saliva got there after Stacey's last shower, which was the night before she was murdered.” \[[https://law.justia.com/cases/texas/court-of-criminal-appeals/2008/17748.html](https://law.justia.com/cases/texas/court-of-criminal-appeals/2008/17748.html) \]

**b)** New testing done in 2014 also showed Reed’s DNA from touch mixed with the victim’s on her back-brace found in the truck, as well as her pants. \[[https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808\_99b68a76d3144c4faac8375a404f376d.pdf](https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808_99b68a76d3144c4faac8375a404f376d.pdf)  \- page 11\]

“Reed also could not be excluded, using Y-STR analysis, from three vaginal swabs, a rectal swab, Stites’s panties, vaginalswab sticks, a vaginal sperm-search slide, and extracts of stains found on Stites’s back brace, pants, and a breast swab. Suppl.CR(DNA).53. This additional testing demonstrated that DNA profiles consistent with Reed’s were in even more locations than what the jury knew about—Stites’s back brace (found in the truck) and her pants (she was wearing).”

\[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/45899/20180507150103836\_Reed%20BIO%20FINAL.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/45899/20180507150103836_Reed%20BIO%20FINAL.pdf)  \- page 13\]

Then there the circumstantial evidence against Reed:

**c)** Reed lied about not knowing Stacey Stites initially. Then came up with the secret affair defense at trial in 1998, only after being presented with the DNA evidence. \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587\_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf)  \- page 207a\] The excuse that he was afraid of admitting to the interracial relationship in small-town racist Bastrop, holds no water, seeing as in 1996, Reed had already had two children with Lucy Eipper, also a white woman. \[[https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808\_88cb22cd079e4d3f8c9c6e9c5dccf1ae.pdf](https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808_88cb22cd079e4d3f8c9c6e9c5dccf1ae.pdf)  \- page 20\]

**d)** Reed´s story about the last time he saw Stacey keeps changing. In 1998 he claimed  the last time he saw her was a few days prior to her death. Then in 2001 it was a day and a half. From 2014 onwards he claimed it was roughly 24 hours prior to her death. \[[https://static.texastribune.org/media/files/66b09bb6ee402879ad65d6b22232446f/Rodney-Reed-ruling.pdf](https://static.texastribune.org/media/files/66b09bb6ee402879ad65d6b22232446f/Rodney-Reed-ruling.pdf) \- page 35\]

**e)** Tests of Jimmy Fennell’s truck, where the prosecution theorizes part of the attack took place, found that a person around 6 feet, 2 was the last driver of the vehicle based on the height of the seat in relation to the mirrors. Reed is 6 feet, 2. \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587\_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf)  \- page 4a-5a, 26a, [https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808\_ff1ce06e53b44745b718717fae875c2b.pdf](https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808_ff1ce06e53b44745b718717fae875c2b.pdf)  \- page 43\]

**f)** Jimmy Fennell’s Truck was found in the Bastrop High School parking lot, about sixth-tenths of a mile, approximately a 15-minute walk, from Reed’s residence at the time of the murder, and in close proximity to the train tracks that Reed often frequented. \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587\_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf)  \- page 116a, 207a\]

**g)** Police often saw Reed on the route Stites would drive for work, in the early hours of the morning. One officer testified that it would be a regular occurrence for him to see Reed in 1995-1997, between 9:00pm and 3:00am in the area. \[[https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/50\_reporters-record\_jury-trial-guilt-innocence-afternoon-session\_volume-50-of-69.pdf](https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/50_reporters-record_jury-trial-guilt-innocence-afternoon-session_volume-50-of-69.pdf)  \- page 70\]

**h)** Unbeknownst to the Jury at trial, Reed became a suspect under very incriminating circumstances. About 6 months after the Stites murder; a woman named Linda Schluter went to police after a tall black man tried to sexually assault her and stole her car, at around 3am in Bastrop. \[[https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808\_26423e4169d34d57b5daba08aca49852.pdf](https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808_26423e4169d34d57b5daba08aca49852.pdf)  \- page 44-47\] Based on her description of the perpetrator, as well the area the attack took place, where police had often seen Reed in those early hours, they zeroed in on Reed and Schlueter picked him out of a photo lineup. Because of the similarities with the Stites case police thought Reed a likely suspect: in addition to the attack taking place around the same time and area, Schlueter’s vehicle was also dumped in close proximity to Reed’s residence. \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/45899/20180507150103836\_Reed%20BIO%20FINAL.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/45899/20180507150103836_Reed%20BIO%20FINAL.pdf)  \- page 5, 8\] It was at this time law enforcement thought to match the DNA found in the Stites murder with Reed. Reed did not become a suspect in the Stites case until late February, early march of 1997, further complicating the allegations of a planned railroading.  \[[https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/46\_reporters-record\_jury-trial-guilt-innocence-phase-afternoon-session\_volume-46-of-69.pdf](https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/46_reporters-record_jury-trial-guilt-innocence-phase-afternoon-session_volume-46-of-69.pdf)  \- page 122\]",11,1657795752.0,False,https://reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/v8fo0j/question_regarding_rodney_reed_convicted_of/ig40zxc/,t1_ifnpa5d,3

The cop fiance did not work the case, nor did his department. The Texas rangers did.

It has never been proven that Reed was in a relationship with Stacey Stites. Infact all the witnesses testifying to this, have had either inconsistencies in their testimony, or waited 15+ years to come forward for no reasonable reason.

The DNA that convicted Reed is solid. Found and in on the victim aswell as her clothes and backbrace. The last two of which was performed with modern testing in 2014. This was both saliva and semen (very few spermatoza but still intact).

The DNA tying him to the other cases is solid. He was a direct match to the semen found in two rape cases. 1 in 5.5 billion.

That´s ignoring the circumstantial evidence pointing to Reed: No alibi. Changing stories. Contradicting stories from his own witnesses. Truck found close to his home. Seatheight in the truck adjusted to match his height. Picked out in photo-line up in similar attack 6 months later.

v8fo0j,ick96ym,ssp92,"This is an often used arguement; He is innocent, because otherwise why the Innocence project take up his case? The innocence project is anti death penalty. They take cases which they think they can win, and cases which will get them the publics attention. This case fits their critereria for a winner down to a tee. Further proven by the other similar case you linked; they know how to pick a winner, regardless of they´re innocent or guilty.  
They have also shown that they like skirting the very edge of truth, and routinely leave out damming pieces of evidence; this case is the perfect example of it. The link you provided has horribly outdated or flat out wong information in it. Just to name a few:  
Their star witness, who claimed Fennell confessed to him in prison, started pleading the 5th during cross, when pressed on inconsistencies in his testimoney. https://static.texastribune.org/media/files/66b09bb6ee402879ad65d6b22232446f/Rodney-Reed-ruling.pdf - page 38  
Furthermore Fennell did not change his testimony on the night of the murder, as they so blatantly claim. Fennell has always stated that he was home and asleep at the time of the murder and that he did notsee or hear Stacey leave. https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/45\_reporters-record\_jury-trial-guilt-innocence-morning-session\_volume-45-of-69-2.pdf - page 84. His friend who claims otherwise, clearly says that he thought that Fennell was out drinking the night of the murder, not that he actually knew. https://edition.cnn.com/2017/09/11/us/texas-rodney-reed-hearing-death-row-stories-new-evidence/index.html - page 31.  
The original medical examiner did not recant his testimoney. https://static.texastribune.org/media/files/66b09bb6ee402879ad65d6b22232446f/Rodney-Reed-ruling.pdf - page 40.  
Neither was it ever proven scientifically that Reed couldn´t have comitted the crime. Infact the medical and forensic experts testifying for the defence, admitted that it was just an estimate, not the surefire science the innocence project makes out to be.  https://static.texastribune.org/media/files/66b09bb6ee402879ad65d6b22232446f/Rodney-Reed-ruling.pdf  - page 40. The state furthermore provided their own expert to discredit the defense theory of time of death.  
The belt hasn´t been tested because, 1) touch DNA wasnt a thing in 1996 and 2) it was handled ungloved at trial and then improperly stored. https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/45899/20180507150103836\_Reed%20BIO%20FINAL.pdf - page 25. Testing it will not brings us the truth.  
Why hasn´t the innocence project removed these ""facts"", or even just added the proper context? Because they know they´re winning in the court of public opinion, and sees no reason for the truth to get in the way of that.  
About the witnesses. Its not personal preference whetner or not they´re credible. They were cross examinated and found to have inconsistencies in their testimony: Not matching with other witnesses or embellishing or contradicting their own affidavits, for no reason. https://static.texastribune.org/media/files/66b09bb6ee402879ad65d6b22232446f/Rodney-Reed-ruling.pdf  - page 26-32. The judge ruled them as not credible them based on those facts. I get what you´re saying, but the legwork was done to discredit them by the state.  Which is why the judged recommended Reed should not get a new trial. You should consider reading his recomendation, as it goes into a lot more into the evidence against Reed and the contradicting theories put forth by the defence. https://static.texastribune.org/media/files/66b09bb6ee402879ad65d6b22232446f/Rodney-Reed-ruling.pdf  
I get why you´d ask, who found her body first. I guess you might be infering some sort of planting or interfering with evidence to took place, before the rangers came in? But how would the cops have had access to his still intact sperm? And even planted touch DNA before they knew it was a thing? Either Reed was in a relationship with Stacey and that explains the DNA evidence, or he raped and murdered her. Planting of evidence is entirely unnecessary based on Reeds own story of the events.  
I´m not saying that injustice in the american justice system or police force doesn´t exist. That would be a straight up lie to claim such a thing. I´m however saying this particular case is an very extremely bad poster child for injustice, when you look into the details of the case, compared to what is being brought up in the trial of public opinion.

The sperm was collected by the medical examiner.  Not the cops. If they would have planted reeds sperm the fay of the murder they probably would not have waited ten months to name Reed as a suspect.

Also The Fiancé fennell wasn't some super cop who was trained in the art of forensics to the point of pulling off the murder of his girlfriend and blaming someone else. He had just started working as a policeman.  Also it was the Texas Rangers who were in charge of the murder investigation from the first day.

The team at Innocence Project have tried to make Jimmy look like a seasoned Homicide detective who had a number of other law enforcement people in cahoots with a murder of one woman. Meanwhile by all sources close to the couple they were in love and days from starting a family together. 

Warped minds conjur up a world where Jimmy was mad because Stacey was pregnant with Reeds baby. They pretend that many of the towns cops were devoted to Jimmy enough to risk their own freedoms to help him get away with a cold blooded murder.

v8fo0j,iknzdcz,ssp92,"It's very hard to follow what you're saying at times, because of your aversion to periods, so I apologogize if I skip over something you consider to be important, of if I misinterprent something. English is not my native language.

My prediction is based on the most recent hearing; in which the judge reckommended Reed should not get a new trial, based on the above reasons among others.  As I've already said; the supreme court is looking over a procedural issue with regards to stature of limitations on DNA testing. Not the actual merits of the case. The Texas court of criminal appeals, is to my knowledge still looking the case over, and has a chance to ignore the recent reckomendation by judge Langley. They're proably a better bet for you than SCOTUS.

Im's sorry, but your argument that you've looked over the case for 20 years, is less impressive, when you all but admitted that some of evidence of his guilt that I presented to you, was new information to you. I've been researching and keeping up with the case for 5 years and while there's certainly are limits to my knowledge,  it's not as comprehensively lacking as you seem to be infering, simply because I'm not from Bastrop. Almost everything on Reed's case, including trial transcripts and the lastest depostion by the defence are readily availible on the internet, so even if I havn't been to the courtroom, I have a pretty good idea exactly was was said in said courtroom. I'm curious: What do you have access to that I have not, over the internet? And more importantly, is that evidence something worth considering, if Reed's lwayers doesn't even seem to think so? Wouldn't they have in interest in presenting it to the public?

I admire your optimism, but there's less than 0% chance of Reed walking free within 4 months. Unless you're talking about 2023, in which case there would at least be the  smallest of chances, depending on SCOTUS and court of criminal appeals, but at that point Reed stil has 4 pending indictments for sexual assualt hanging over his head.

v8fo0j,if88zj5,None,"On October 30, 2014, Alstory Simon was freed from Prison after spending nearly 15 years behind bar after being framed by the Innocence Project. There is a book explaining the case and there is a documentary on it.      Here is what they say about Reed.  
“The murder weapon has never been tested for DNA evidence.”  
Stacey Stites was strangled with her own belt, which actually broke, she was strangled so hard. The belt would have been examined at the time, but in 1996, DNA profiling wasn’t the force it is today. It would be another decade before touch DNA analysis was possible, by which time the belt had been handled by many people from police officers to trial lawyers. Obviously the Innocence Project know this, but they make this claim to mislead the public.

“The State’s forensic experts have admitted to errors in their testimonies, which led to Rodney’s conviction and death sentence.”
  
No they haven’t, an outright lie, or at best a distortion.

“Rodney Reed and Stacey Stites were having a consensual sexual relationship. At the time of the trial, no one came forward to corroborate their relationship. But today, new witnesses including Stacey’s own cousin and co-worker have corroborated Rodney’s claim that they knew that he and Stacey were romantically involved.”
  
More lies. Reed and Stacey lived in different towns over twenty miles apart. She was working a shift that started when most people are in bed. How they met for these sexual liaisons hasn’t been properly explained, even though Reed has had more than two decades to get his story straight. The testimony of Stacey’s co-worker is ludicrous; she is very likely simply an attention seeker.

“Renowned forensic pathologists have concluded that Rodney’s guilt is medically and scientifically impossible. The prosecution’s only forensic evidence linking Rodney to the crime was semen taken from Stacey’s body, which was attributed to the consensual relationship between them.”
  
Including on her chest while she was on her way to work? An utterly ridiculous claim.

“Jimmy’s best friend at the time of the crime, Bastrop Sheriff’s Officer Curtis Davis, has now revealed that Jimmy gave an inconsistent account of where he was on the night of the murder.”
  
Memory is a strange thing, but again, Jimmy Fennell could not have murdered Stacey. She was clearly murdered in his truck and her body dumped in the woods. There is no way he could have done this and got back to Giddings in the allotted time.

“Jimmy later served a 10-year prison term for a sex crime and kidnapping he committed while on duty.”
  
This is superficially damning, but leaving aside the fact that the circumstances of this crime – for which Fennell paid a heavy price – it doesn’t alter the fact that he couldn’t have murdered Stacey. Without wishing to mitigate for him, it should be pointed out that people who suffer tragedy often go off the deep end, so to speak. A year after he committed suicide, the mother of teenager Jay Cheshire killed herself. The father of murder victim Sarah Payne committed slow motion suicide by drinking himself to death over a fourteen year period, during which time he did all sorts of stupid things. People who really know Fennell say he was deeply affected by Stacey’s death; being a suspect all that time may have tipped him over the edge.

“This case was racially charged. Rodney, a Black man, was found guilty of murdering Stacey, a white woman, by an all-white jury.”
  
And white people can never be trusted, right? It is truly amazing that every time a black suspect is convicted in the United States, we are told the jury pool was tainted.

“A confession by Jimmy Fennell has come to light. On Oct. 29, 2019 Arthur Snow, a former member of the Aryan Brotherhood and Jimmy’s prison mate, disclosed that Jimmy had confessed to murdering Stacey stating, “I had to kill my n\*\*\*\*\*-loving fiancée,” in a conversation.”

Some people even think that I´m connected to the case in some way. Its pretty crazy, and entirely baseless. 

I fail to see how the fact that I used sources that PREDATES the lies told by the innocent project, is somehow a slight against my sources but not the innonce project themselves? They had the sources availible to them in 2019, yet chose to ignore it. As I also proved to you, many of their points are by now outdated, yet their 2019 website of ""facts"" still stands. 

I believe, that based on the evidence currenly availible to us Reed is guilty. 20+ years of post-litegation have contiuned to prove this. It is completely fine for you to come to a different conclusion. But this smells more like the backfire effect to me. We both want justice. Nobody wants an innocent man to get punished for something he didn´t do. You came into this with the theory of innocence, or at the very aleast reasonable doubt.

Whataboutism aside, this about the integrety of the innocence project; Of which I've provided mutiple sources for why the initial link you, your self posted and took as gospel about the the case, was at best half-truths mussing important context, and at best direct lies.

v8fo0j,igr3rzn,ssp92,"Okay, Sorry I put words into your mouth. In your initial comments you infered that Reed was innocent based on the fact that the Innocence project took up his case. You mentioned their vetting process was extensive, leading me to believe that was your argument for innocence, and or reasonable doubt. Since we're in the same ballpark; I don't believe 100% Reed is guilty, because I can't know for sure, but based on the evidence currently availible to us, he sure looks guilty beyound a reasonable doubt. That doesn't mean I couldn't change my mind, if some credible evidence of innocence turned up.

I support the sentiment of the innocence project. Any reasonable person would support justice for the innocent and punishment for the guilty. The problem comes when they won't admit that the're backing a guilty person, and are willing to stretch the truths to extreme lenghts to protect their client. 

You seem to be knowledgeable on the workings of the IP, so have you ever seen them drop a case, when overwhelming evidence of guilt turned up? I havn't, but admittedly I havn't looked very thoughly. Came across this one though; [https://news.yahoo.com/defense-lawyer-stands-acquitted-suspect-220000219.html?guccounter=1&guce\_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce\_referrer\_sig=AQAAALJxxBhxsr5vcpTYBSjdjoO1Ymlkbe4JrMSASVlOTGEILKEROtEwkU8y1JGxjW58ELjVpZ\_WOxnNMxcRB3xdfNs7dNB0-2MF3ORmX5BCki\_sl-Gk0c-Nz9uVcxNkJqhNp3rsN9eyxoC43Nxfxvk\_dz2R2vBPfP9ej7UR-TUZK45V](https://news.yahoo.com/defense-lawyer-stands-acquitted-suspect-220000219.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALJxxBhxsr5vcpTYBSjdjoO1Ymlkbe4JrMSASVlOTGEILKEROtEwkU8y1JGxjW58ELjVpZ_WOxnNMxcRB3xdfNs7dNB0-2MF3ORmX5BCki_sl-Gk0c-Nz9uVcxNkJqhNp3rsN9eyxoC43Nxfxvk_dz2R2vBPfP9ej7UR-TUZK45V) 

Extremely courious to see how Reed's lawyers would react, if Reed is granted DNA testing of the belt, and it comes back as a match to him. 

I hope that in the time people will see that the innonce project is not infallible. This will ultimately help justice in the end. But people don't like hearing the IP makes mistakes, precisely because they're been so highly endorsed and buildt up to be so righteous. Right now, people simply doesn't want to hear that the innoncence porject backs guilty persons. The truth can hurt. 

Why be so gung ho about this case? Well you almost said it yourself; in this case there's DNA evidence pointing to the guilty man. In 9 out of 10 cases the wrongfully convicted are exonerated by DNA, whereas here I don't see any untested DNA which could reasonable exonerate Reed. A match on Fenell from the murder weapon could be seen as circumstantial, seeing as he lived with Stacey and is likely to have touched her belt at one point or another. 

I came into this case not knowing what to find. I was conflicted initially; the evidence presented in the media pointed in different directions, but mostly towards innocence. The inner conflict was replaced with anger, when I saw how many lies were being told behalf of Reed. There is no nuance what so ever. So if I seem biased, I'd like to badly excuse, that as a response to extreme quantity of biased articles pointing to Reeds innocence, while ignoring the evidence to the contrary. You have go pretty deep on google before you can even find an article not in favour of innocence. It has gotten noticebly better though. In 2019, the evidence in favour of guilt was entirely buried. 

I see your point about the jailhouse snitches overall; the argument that they're more likely to lie for the prosecution seems reasonable. In this case, as I mentioned, the informant started pleading the 5th, when pressed on inconsistencies, leading me to believe that he is lying, so some incentive to lie must have been there. Is it not possible that he could have had a reward in the form a reduced sentence, if Reed's sentence was vacated, and Fennell convicted?",1,1658218252.0,False,https://reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/v8fo0j/question_regarding_rodney_reed_convicted_of/igr3rzn/,t1_ige90dr,7

ubnqy7,i66j8d8,SerHodorTheTall,"I wouldn't assign too much weight to criticism of a ""piecemeal"" post conviction case. In pretty much all post conviction litigation a defendant has to raise the claims as they become apparent or else they risk waiving them, so they wind up ""piecemeal"". Basically, every post conviction case is apt to be labeled either delayed or piecemeal, so it's not a particularly helpful or fair term. Moreover, the fact that post conviction procedures usually require a piecemeal approach is largely a detriment to the defendant, who would often be in a better position if the courts would actually look at all the problems in the case all at once. 

Specific to the Brady claim, though, the defense couldn't really raise the issue until the State admitted they had concealed that evidence. So I especially wouldn't blame the defense on that one. 

I also wouldn't place too much weight on the number of habeas writs or number of judges that have reviewed a case. The raw number of judges just really doesn't mean as it depends on what they were reviewing.

ubnqy7,i666v9u,Aromatic_Power7082,"quoting annother redditor:


  
This is absolute dog shit. Lee was serial rapist and murderer. The victim's DNA was found on his shoe. He was found using the victim's money. Moreover, multiple witnesses placed him at the scene of the crime.
  

  
What's even more damning? His DNA was linked to multiple rapes and another rape/murder.
  

  
The actual court records:
  

  

  

  
William McCullough Jr. lived near the victim’s house and had been home on the morning in question. Sometime between 10:00 a.m.and 11:00 a.m., he heard a knock at his door. McCullough went to the door and was met by a man who asked to borrow some tools. McCullough gave the man a driver ratchet and a socket, which he promised to return. The man did not return the tools.
  

  
At approximately 10:50 a.m. on the morning of the murder, Katherine Williams, the victim’s mother, received a phone call from her daughter, who lived some four or five houses away. A man had just knocked on the victim’s door, asked if her husband was home, and inquired about borrowing some tools. When the victim replied that she had no tools, the man left. According to Katherine, her daughter told her that she was scared and “did not trust this guy.” The victim promised her mother that she would be at her house as soon as she finished curling her hair. Her daughter never arrived.
  

  
Andy Gomez lived across the street from the victim, and was also home on the morning in question. While looking out his front window, he saw a man standing at the front door of the victim's residence. He watched the man grab the screen door and “make a B-line inside just real fast.” Approximately twenty minutes later, the man exited Debra’s residence. According to Gomez, the man made rapid–head movements, as if he was checking to see if he was being watched. Suspicious, Gomez got in his car to follow the man. He caught up with him on a nearby street, where he observed the man talking to a female with spirals or braids in her hair.
  

  
Glenda Pruitt lived at 128 Galloway Circle on the date in question. A man she had seen four or five times and knew as “Skip” walked up her street. Glenda, who wore her hair in long braids, had a short conversation with Skip as he passed by her house. McCullough, Gomez, and Pruitt identified Lee in a photographic lineup as the man they had seen in the victim’s neighborhood on the morning of her murder.
  

  
Debra’s body was discovered in her bedroom at approximately 1:38 p.m. that same date. Three one hundred dollar bills that Debra’s father, Stephen Williams, had given to her were missing from her wallet. This money had been part of a larger stack of crisp new bills Williams received in sequential order from the Arkansas Federal Credit Union.
  

  
At Lee’s trial, the State offered evidence that, at 1:53 p.m. on the day of the murder, Lee paid a debt at the Rent–A–Center with a one-hundred dollar bill. Of the three one-hundred dollar bills that the Rent–A–Center received on February 9, one of the bills bore a serial number that was two bills away from one of the bills that the victim’s father had turned over to police.",-1,1650915888.0,False,https://reddit.com/r/scotus/comments/ubnqy7/scotus_agrees_to_take_up_death_row_inmate_rodney/i666v9u/,t1_i65rsti,5
ubnqy7,i66okti,SerHodorTheTall,"Yeah, I haven't argued that Reed is or isn't innocent. 

Personally, I don't find either the State's theory of the case or Reed's innocence arguments particularly compelling at this point in  light of the subsequent information that has developed including the DNA and subsequent witness statements. 

I do find the CCA and district court's characterizations of abuse of process / piecemeal filings / allegations of delay fairly ridiculous for both the reasons I mentioned above, and the fact that they ignore that Reed's defense team has changed over the years, so it's not like there's even some unified defense strategy of delay. Courts are far too dismissive of the fact that late arising post conviction claims can often come from new eyes on the case rather than absurd allegations of delay.

ubnqy7,i674z0p,SerHodorTheTall,"What is that summary you linked to? Are those notes that someone made?

I don't find the DNA particularly compelling because it just establishes physical / sexual contact, not murder. That was already the case at the time of the trial. And, at trial, the inference that the DNA proved the murder appears based on the idea that Reed did not know the victim, and, thus, violence was the only likely way the DNA got there. 

Now, there are several witnesses that testify there was some some kind of contact or relationship between Reed and the victim. If those claims are true they refute the State's theory that the DNA could have only gotten there by violence. 

That said, just because there are witnesses to Reed and the victim interacting also doesn't inherently prove his innocence, just that the State's theory at trial was incorrect. 

While you mention some reasons to be skeptical of the credibility of some of those witnesses, that does not prove that they are incorrect or liars, so they can't be discounted. And, the recent Brady claim indicates the State knew at the time of trial about some of those claims by witnesses, so there are even contemporary claims.

Likewise, some of the disputes about the other witnesses come from conflicting statements from the husband, who is the main SODDI. So there's reason to be skeptical of all that too.

qwz6ye,hlmwxke,ssp92,"This take is probably the most misinformed, factually dubious and onesided take I've seen on this case in quite a while.

The amount of disinformation is almost so impressively huge, so I won't be able to adress it all, not to mention all the details of Reeds guilt left out.

**1)** The author states: ""The framing of Rodney Reed began a year later based solely on the presence of Reed’s semen inside of Stites."" This is not accurate; unbeknownst to the Jury at trial, Reed became a suspect under very incriminating circumstances. About 6 months after the Stites murder; a woman named Linda Schluter went to police after a tall black man tried to sexually assault her and stole her car, at around 3am in Bastrop. \[[https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808\_26423e4169d34d57b5daba08aca49852.pdf](https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808_26423e4169d34d57b5daba08aca49852.pdf)  \- page 44-47\] Based on her description of the perpetrator, as well the area the attack took place, where police had often seen Reed in those early hours, they zeroed in on Reed and Schlueter picked him out of a photo lineup. Because of the similarities with the Stites case police thought Reed a likely suspect: in addition to the attack taking place around the same time and area, Schlueter’s vehicle was also dumped in close proximity to Reed’s residence.  \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/45899/20180507150103836\_Reed%20BIO%20FINAL.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/45899/20180507150103836_Reed%20BIO%20FINAL.pdf)   \- page 5, 8\] It was at this time law enforcement thought to match the DNA found in the Stites murder with Reed. Reed did not become a suspect in the Stites case until late February, early march of 1997. \[[https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/46\_reporters-record\_jury-trial-guilt-innocence-phase-afternoon-session\_volume-46-of-69.pdf](https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/46_reporters-record_jury-trial-guilt-innocence-phase-afternoon-session_volume-46-of-69.pdf)  \- page 122\]

**2)** The author states: ""However, both Reed and friends of Stites maintained that the two had a casual relationship and met regularly. ""

Reed lied about not knowing Stacey initially. Then came up with the secret affair defense at trial in 1998, only after being presented with the DNA evidence. \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587\_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf)   \- page 207a\] The argument that he was afraid of admitting to the interracial relationship in small-town racist Bastrop, holds no water, seeing as in 1996, Reed had already had two children with Lucy Eipper, also a white woman. \[[https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808\_88cb22cd079e4d3f8c9c6e9c5dccf1ae.pdf](https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808_88cb22cd079e4d3f8c9c6e9c5dccf1ae.pdf)  \- page 20\]

It might also be worth mentioning that between the murder in April, 1996, and Reed’s arrest in May 1997, not one single person came forward to point out this alleged secret relationship; this is in spite of a $50.000 reward being offered by Stacey’s place of work. Everyone remotely connected to Stacey were also interviewed by the police:

“Over the course of the next eleven months, authorities focused their investigation on people that Stacey knew, and with a $50,000 reward offered by H.E.B., numerous leads and information poured in. For instance, a newspaper-delivery person reported that Stacey's body was not on Bluebonnet Drive when he drove by the site where her body was found at 4:00 a.m. In all, officials interviewed hundreds of people, including former classmates, boyfriends, and coworkers, as well as Stacey's friends and coworkers at H.E.B. “

\[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587\_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf)  \- page 112a\]

**3)** The author states: ""Forensic experts have testified that Stites’ time of death was much earlier than the official record stated, which was based entirely on the word of Jimmy Fennell. At her actual time of death, she would have been alone with Fennell in the apartment they shared together.

The author fails to mention is that time of death is not an exact science; hundreds of variables factor in, and to give an accurate estimate isn’t easy, especially two decades after the murder, based only on photos and video, which was how this new estimate was made. It is by no means ironclad. ""(...) Dr. Baden asserts that Stites was deceased before midnighton April 22, 1996. During his testimony at the evidentiary inApplicant's eighth habeas proceeding, Dr. Baden admitted thatreasonable forensic pathologists could look at the same evidence andcome up with a different time of death. In his report, Dr. Spitz assertedthat Stites was deceased between 6:00pm to 10:00pm on April 22, 1996.In his fourth affidavit, Dr. Riddick asserted that Stites was deceasedbetween 9:15 pm on April 22, 1996, to 1:15am April 23, 1996. In Dr.Riddick's prior affidavits, Dr. Spitz asserted that no reliable time ofdeath couldbe discerned from the evidence in this case. "" \[[https://static.texastribune.org/media/files/66b09bb6ee402879ad65d6b22232446f/Rodney-Reed-ruling.pdf?\_ga=2.56567211.1064635482.1637586047-1285570680.1637586047](https://static.texastribune.org/media/files/66b09bb6ee402879ad65d6b22232446f/Rodney-Reed-ruling.pdf?_ga=2.56567211.1064635482.1637586047-1285570680.1637586047) \- page 40\]

We can’t know 100% for sure when Stacey Sites died, but it’s certainly not outside the bounds of reason that Stacey was killed after 3:00 am on April 23th, 1996, seeing as the body was found wearing earrings, contact lenses, partially dressed in her work uniform, complete with her nametag nearby, knee brace (Stuffed with tissues to prevent chafing) and back brace, found in the truck, where the prosecution theorizes part of the assault took place. \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587\_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf) \- page 206a\] For all intents and purposes it looks like Stacey was attacked on her way to work.

**4)** The author states: ""The Giddings Police Department and legal system not only failed to intervene in the sale of the truck or properly investigate the crime — they may have even aided a cover-up, based on DNA evidence found at the crime scene. DNA matching two Giddings police officers was found on two beer cans near the body. ""

It is true that, initial, very broad, DQ-alpha DNA testing of the beer cans could not exclude the victim, Stacey Stites and two cops, Ed Selmela/Salmela (spelling differs), who was investigating the murder, and lastly David Hall, who was close with Jimmy Fennell and lived in the same apartment complex. \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587\_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf)  \- page 125a\]

A more thorough DNA test done by the defense’s own expert, Dr. Johnson, ruled out all three as contributors of the DNA on the beer cans in 1998.

qwz6ye,ho5b9gx,LOBrienC-C,"""4) The author states: ""The Giddings Police Department and legal system not only failed to intervene in the sale of the truck or properly investigate the crime — they may have even aided a cover-up, based on DNA evidence found at the crime scene. DNA matching two Giddings police officers was found on two beer cans near the body. ""

There has never been any evidence that a crime occurred in Giddings, which deprives Giddings Police of jurisdiction to ""intervene"" in the case in any way, shape or form.  The truck was found parked in Bastrop, 35 miles away and towed from that scene (a convenient 6/10 of a mile from the place Reed lived) to be processed by the Texas DPS in Austin.  The truck was returned 6 days later to its rightful owner, Jimmy Fennell, once that processing was exhausted by the limits of forensic science in 1996.

The alleged DNA on the beer cans was HLA-DQ Alpha did not implicate 2 Giddings officers as falsely stated.  The DNA also was found on only 1 of 2 cans, not on 2 cans.  The inconclusive results could not eliminate 1 Giddings officer (David Hall), 1 Bastrop officer (Ed Salmela) and Stacey.  Subsequent PCR testing (more discriminating than HLA-DQ Alpha) done by Reed's expert witness, who had performed HLA-DQ Alpha testing with the same results, excluded Hall, Salmela and Stites.  Reinterpretation requested by Reed's counsel and subsequent testing provided sufficient data for Reed's experts to claim Hall could not really be eliminated, but this new interpretation does not convert the results from inconclusive to conclusive.",1,1639246276.0,False,https://reddit.com/r/2020Reclamation/comments/qwz6ye/rodney_reed_denied_new_trial_despite_overwhelming/ho5b9gx/,t3_qwz6ye,0

The rape and murder of Stites was hardly Reed’s first or last foray against women. First was Connie York, a nineteen-year-old who had come home late one evening after swimming with friends. 57.RR.34–35. York was grabbed from behind and told “don’t scream or I’ll hurt you.” 57.RR.35–36. When York did not listen, she was repeatedly struck, dragged to her bedroom, and raped multiple times. 57.RR.37–42.
  

  
Reed was interviewed, and, while he admitted that he knew York from high school, he denied raping her. 57.RR.123–24. When confronted with a search warrant for biological samples, Reed had an about-face, “Yeah, I had sex with her, she wanted it.” 57.RR.138. The case went to trial four years later, 57.RR.30, 60, and Reed was acquitted, 57.RR.61.
  

  
Next was A.W., a twelve-year-old girl, who was home alone, having fallen asleep on a couch after watching TV. 58.RR.36–42. A.W. awoke when someone began pushing her face into the couch and had blindfolded and gagged her. 58.RR.42–43. She was repeatedly hit in the head, called vulgar names, and orally, vaginally, and anally raped. 58.RR.43–49. The foreign DNA from A.W.’s rape kit was compared to Reed; Reed was not excluded and only one in 5.5 billion people would have the same foreign DNA profile from A.W.’s rape kit. 58.RR.51, 92;61.RR.26.
  

  
Then came Lucy Eipper, who Reed had met in high school, and whom Reed began to date after her graduation. 59.RR.10–12. Eipper had two children with Reed. 59.RR.13–14, 19–20 Throughout their relationship, Reed physically abused Eipper, including while she was pregnant, and raped her “all the time,” including one time in front of their two children. 59.RR.14–17, 21, 25–32.Afterwards, Reed began dating Caroline Rivas, an intellectually disabled woman. 60.RR.39–41. Rivas’s caseworker noticed bruises on Rivas’s body and, when asked about them, Rivas admitted that Reed would hurt her if she would not have sex with him. 60.RR.41, 61.Later, Rivas’s caseworker noticed that Rivas was walking oddly and sat down gingerly. 60.RR.43. Rivas admitted that Reed had, the prior evening, hit her, called her vulgar names, and anally raped her. 60.RR.44, 63–65. The samples from Rivas’s rape kit provided the link to Stites’s murder. 60.RR.89–90.Shortly thereafter, and about six months before Stites’s murder, Reed raped Vivian Harbottle underneath a train trestle as she was walking home. 59.RR.87–92. When she pleaded for her life for the sake of her children, Reed laughed at her. 59.RR.94. The foreign DNA from Harbottle’s rape kit Awas compared to Reed; he could not be excluded, and only one person in 5.5 billion would be expected to have the same foreign DNA profile. 59.RR.95, 113–14; 61.RR.26.
  

  
Finally, and about six months after Stites’s murder, Reed convinced nineteen-year-old Linda Schlueter to give him a ride home at about 3:30 a.m. 61.RR.10, 37–47. Reed led her to a remote area and then attacked her. 61.RR.47–58. After a prolonged struggle, Schlueter asked Reed what he wanted and Reed responded, “I want a blow job.” 61.RR.60. When Schlueter told Reed that “you will have to kill me before you get anything,” Reed stated “I guess I’ll have to kill you then.” 61.RR.60. Before Schlueter could be raped, a car drove by and Reed fled. 61.RR.62–64.

qndcuo,hji73ky,TXProsecutin13,"This is a good example of people that don’t know what they are talking about interjecting themselves into something they assume is easy to understand. 

You cannot view criminal law/justice in a vacuum. New evidence and recantations occur all the time and likely at the haste of a writ attorney or someone working for actual innocence (not to say mistakes arent made). 

What is important is to realize that the jury is best positioned to make the decision at the time. With technological advances, DNA analysis can exonerate but the absence of direct linkage via DNA does not mean the crime didn’t happen. 

I cannot say with confidence whether Reed is guilty because I have not reviewed the evidence and I did not hear testimony at trial. I encourage you to trust your criminal justice system on its face but make sure to hold the prosecution to their burden. Many checks are built into the system to ensure the validity of a conviction / sentence. Be aware of your rights and assert them with respect.

The former fiancé was also tested against DNA from the rape and DNA found at the scene, and there was no match. The only one who matched was Reed.

A.W. awoke when someone began pushing her face into the couch and had blindfolded and gagged her. 58.RR.42–43.

Eipper had two children with Reed. 59.RR.13–14, 19–20 Throughout their relationship, Reed physically abused Eipper, including while she was pregnant, and raped her “all the time,” including one time in front of their two children. 59.RR.14–17, 21, 25–32.Afterwards, Reed began dating Caroline Rivas, an intellectually disabled woman. 60.RR.39–41. Rivas’s caseworker noticed bruises on Rivas’s body and, when asked about them, Rivas admitted that Reed would hurt her if she would not have sex with him. 60.RR.41, 61.Later, Rivas’s caseworker noticed that Rivas was walking oddly and sat down gingerly. 60.RR.43. Rivas admitted that Reed had, the prior evening, hit her, called her vulgar names, and anally raped her. 60.RR.44, 63–65. The samples from Rivas’s rape kit provided the link to Stites’s murder. 60.RR.89–90.Shortly thereafter, and about six months before Stites’s murder, Reed raped Vivian Harbottle underneath a train trestle as she was walking home. 59.RR.87–92. When she pleaded for her life for the sake of her children, Reed laughed at her. 59.RR.94. The foreign DNA from Harbottle’s rape kit Awas compared to Reed; he could not be excluded, and only one person in 5.5 billion would be expected to have the same foreign DNA profile. 59.RR.95, 113–14; 61.RR.26.

Finally, and about six months after Stites’s murder, Reed convinced nineteen-year-old Linda Schlueter to give him a ride home at about 3:30 a.m. 61.RR.10, 37–47. Reed led her to a remote area and then attacked her. 61.RR.47–58. After a prolonged struggle, Schlueter asked Reed what he wanted and Reed responded, “I want a blow job.” 61.RR.60. When Schlueter told Reed that “you will have to kill me before you get anything,” Reed stated “I guess I’ll have to kill you then.” 61.RR.60. Before Schlueter could be raped, a car drove by and Reed fled. 61.RR.62–64.

qkh1yo,hixjsr0,dances_with_corgis,"Great question.  Here's why I will defend Rodney Reed.  I lived in Bastrop during this time.  In 1995, Bastrop was divided by a racial boundary, aka the ""Railroad tracks"".  The local police, and Sheriff, and Detective were all corrupt.  The detective I'm referring to, Ed Salmelha was in particular the detective that wrote the investigative report where the evidence was identified and times were given as to the crime scene with Stacey Stites.  Shortly afterwards, Ed Salmelha was found dead.  The rumor around where I lived was that it was a self-inflicted gunshot wound due to his mistress (who worked for him at his convenience store) not wanting to leave her husband.  Either way, the man who wrote the report is dead.  This same individual frequently stopped me and on many occassions attempted to charge me with a crime I wasn't committing.  For example, he found my backpack, noticed some hole punch circles from my homework, and decided that I was dealing LSD and needed my hole punches tested.  Long story short: ALL of the cops were corrupt during this period in Bastrop history.  Not some, but ALL.  
  
edit:  What I failed to mention was that they were a menacing presence in Bastrop.  The cops were not highly regarded as one would expect in a town or small city.

qkh1yo,hj6bi1z,sammytheammonite,"Only one person’s DNA was all over the crime scene, including inside the truck. And that is Reed’s. It’s very unlikely he actually had a relationship with her. No one came forward in the 11 months between her death and his arrest for her murder to divulge any info about Reed or any affair she was having. And that includes all her co-workers who were extensively interviewed, including the two that came forward only 20 years after the fact. Super unreliable ‘witnesses’.

As for the DNA: she woke and showered as normal that morning. She put on fresh underwear. She put on her work pants, her work shirt, and her name tag. She placed her back brace in her truck (she wore this while at work). Her work shirt was forcibly removed. Her underwear and work pants were bunched at her hips. Her shoes were not in her feet. She had seminal DNA in her vagina, in her anus and in her panties. All matched Reed. She also had saliva DNA in her chest and breasts - also matched Reed. Saliva DNA doesn’t stay on the skin after two days and two showers (she also showered the day before, after Reed claimed that had a consensual encounter). They found Rodney’s touch DNA in her work pants that she put on that morning and on the back brace in the truck. 

She was strangled with her own belt. Two of Reed’s other victims were strangled with a belt as they were raped. He also sodomized his other victims. 

Reed frequented a small convenience near his home at odd hours. It was at this store that he asked for a ride and then later raped the women who gave him that ride. Stacey was known to stop at this store in her way to work, as it was along her route and was open at the time she headed to work super early in the AM. The store is less than half a mile from Reed’s home. I’m guessing that’s where they crossed paths. 

The truck was found at a high school less than a mile from Reed’s home and more than 30 miles from the home Stacey shared with her fiancé and her mother. The seat belt was still buckled - she was ripped from the vehicle without unbuckling it. The seat had been pushed back and matched someone Reed’s height (he is much taller than both Stacey and Fennell). 

Reed was literally raping women before and after her rape and murder. One woman testified that he said he was going to kill her and she only escaped because a car passed by - his DNA matched her rape kit. Another woman ten years prior claimed he raped her and strangled her with a belt. He was arrested for that crime and it went to trial. He claimed that the encounter was consensual and that it was a secret because she was white and he black. Sound familiar?

He also raped a 13 year old - DNA matched her rape kit as well.

Need I go on?

And you think he is the less likely one to have committed this crime?

He also beat the white mother of his children regularly, and raped and beat another woman he dated. He clearly is capable of harming even those he has a relationship with. So, even if he could prove a relationship - that doesn’t mean he didn’t kill her. He’s never testified that they had a relationship, btw. And any witness claiming knowledge of a relationship has been proven to be extremely non credible. 

I have no doubt that Fennel is also a shitty human being. But there is zero evidence linking him to this crime and an abundance of evidence linking Reed. At the time of his trial - only HIS friend’s claimed knowledge of a relationship, and not even his own defense would put them on the stand because they were simply not credible at all. The other two people only came forward after 20 years. Also not credible. These were people that were questioned by police at the time and said nothing. Nothing at all until this case became a popular talking point in the news.

This is a declaration of the former M.E. who performed the autopsy.

DECLARATION 0F ROBERTO J. BAYARDO M.D. - dated  Aug 13, 2012

4. Survival of Sperm. At trial, I testified that the very few spermatozoa l found in Ms. Stites’s vaginal cavity had been deposited there “quite recently.” Ms. Blakely testied that spermatozoa can remain intact in the vaginal cavity for no more than 26 hours; and Ms. Clement testied that spermatozoa can remain intact for no more than 24 hours. I question the qualications of these witnesses to offer this testimony, and in any event, they are incorrect. I am personally aware of medical literature finding that spermatozoa can remain intact in the vaginal cavity for days after death. Accordingly, in my professional opinion, the spermatozoa I found in Ms. Stites’s vaginal cavity could have been deposited days before her death. Further, the fact that I found “very few” (as stated in the autopsy report) spermatozoa in Ms. Stites’s vaginal cavity suggests that the spermatozoa was not deposited less than 24 hours before Ms. Stites’s death. If the prosecuting attorneys had advised me that they intended to present testimony that spermatozoa cannot remain intactin the vaginal cavity for more than 26 hours, and argue that Ms. Stites died within 24 hours of the spermatozoa being deposited, I would have advised them that neither the testimony nor the argument was medically or scientically supported.

&#x200B;

Now, there was saliva and mucus found at the the scene. This is from an affidavit of Warner Spitz, MD:

1 . My review of the autopsy report. autopsy photos. crime scene photos, crime scene video, and report of crime scene investigation leads me to conclude that Stacey Stites was murdered prior to midnight on April 22, 1996 (the night before her body was found). And further that she laid in a different position for about 4-5 hours before she was moved to the location where the body was found.

2. The lividity (livor mortis, red purple discoloration due to pooling of blood after death) on Stites's face, shoulder, and arm, scientifically proves that she was dead in a position different from that which she was found for a period of at least 4- 5 hours. This pattern of lividity seen on the anterior arm, chest, shoulder, and face would develop if Stites was lying face down with one arm lower than the rest of the body for 4-5 hours, before she was moved to the position in which she was found. lt is impossible that this lividity occurred at the scene in the position the body was found because Stites‘s body was found on her back. i have reviewed investigation reports indicating that mucus—like fluid was found near the passenger floor board of the truck belonging to Stites’s fiance. The presence of this fluid in combination with the lividity on the arm, shoulder and face is consistent with Stites being killed at a different location and later placed into the pickup truck, resting with her face and arm lower than the rest of the body. This would explain both the mucus-like fluid near the passenger floor of truck and the blanching (areas where blood is pressed out of the skin) on the fingers as if pressed into something after death.

6. Very few sperm were found on autopsy smears, and the crime scene investigator found only 3 intact spermatozoa. if the victim was sexually assaulted between 3-5 a.m., there would be more sperm found on slides. A normal sperm count is considered to be 15 million spermatozoa per milliliter. The amount of sperm found on the slides is more consistent with a longer interval between intercourse and the time the sample was collected. As l explain in my book, intact spermatozoa can be found in the vagina up to 72 hours after coitus.

He was a member of the aryan brotherhood and was hired by fennell to protect him while in prison - until he found out that he was a cop and stopped. Fennel snitched on him and as a result, he was moved from a minimum security part of the prison to a maximum security part, separating him from the other brotherhood members. He talks about this in his statement. He has a reason to lie. Not to mention - jailhouse confessions like this are notoriously not credible at all. 

There is no other person who has testified in any way that fennel confessed. 

Everyone else you mention came forward more THAN 20 years after the fact. And the recent court recommendation fully explains why they are either unreliable or not credible. If they were credible, they would have come forward when it occurred, not over 20 years later. 

As for the belt - there is literal testimony from Reed’s other victims that he used a belt to strangle them. That is not hearsay. Someone claiming Fennell made a one off statement, also 20 years after the fact, is not credible. For obvious reasons. Again, if they were credible, they would have come forward at the time of her murder. Weird how NONE of these ‘witnesses’ came forward back then. None. And when asked why - they have no credible excuse. 

And people say odd things after someone they love has died - and anger is a known stage of grief. Even if he actually said that (again, didn’t come forward for over 20 years), it can be explained away by this fact. It isn’t evidence AT ALL that he was involved in her death. 

Unreliable witnesses that come forward over 20 years after the incident took place aren’t very food ‘reasonable doubt’. Maybe if they had come forward at the time - they could have been.

qkh1yo,hs6iirm,TAacctCA,">I advise you to look at the report of the judge instead of pieces that only suit your narrative.

You don't find it odd that a retired judge with multiple [complaints going back to at least 2006](https://theeagle.com/news/local/harassment-investigation-of-langley-inconclusive/article_a96fdee4-4857-5995-8bc6-3e927be535d5.html) was called back in to pick up a controversial case? How is it that you believe a judge who chooses to dismiss dozens of credible witnesses along with the statements of medical professionals, but you don't believe in reasonable doubt? I'm looking at **scientific evidence**, not the **opinion** of a judge with several racism and sexism complaints. According to that rationale, maybe we should have called in Nixon to run the country when Reagan was shot.    


Langley's sections of ""Supposed recantations"" and ""Supposed confessions"" that he chose to ignore is over 5 pages long. He also chose to ignore credible scientific evidence from a lab - the same people that that actually test the evidence. Basically dude zoned out during the trial and just refused to listen to any testimony. His mind was made up before he was called in. But you know, that's how the good boy network keeps this MAGA country ""great"".  Oh, and let's not forget, the lead prosecutor is fired in the middle of the trail but we are supposed to believe that ""the allegation that  prosecutor’s office hid evidence should be dismissed"". OK, yeah.

&#x200B;

Langley wrote, Reed “has not proven with clear and convincing evidence of his innocence.” First, this statement is biased. Second, he threw out the evidence. And third, the Presumption of Innocence; Proof Beyond a Reasonable Doubt, has been referred to in legal case study hundreds of thousands of times, while the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments are meant to ensure that you not convicted until proven guilty “beyond a reasonable doubt.” Reed couldn't even get a his peers - which any lawyer will tell you sets the foundation for everything.

&#x200B;

I don't know if he did it or not, but the reality is that I have gone through the evidence and reports. There is enough evidence to create reasonable doubt for him to at minimum get a new trial. 

&#x200B;

And where is your proof that there were more than 3 sperm cells? Where is the information about Reed's saliva on her chest?

qkh1yo,hs6lues,TAacctCA,">Here is one of them which discusses the semen in her panties and saliva on her chest

Where does it present evidence of Reed's saliva being on her chest? Reading and comprehension are valuable tools. It clearly says ""The State's theory at trial was that Reed's DNA profile found in the semen deposited in Stites's vagina and rectum and in the saliva on her breast clearly indicated that Reed had sex with Stites.""    
Theory does not equal evidence or proof.  I can have a theory that the world is going to end tomorrow, but that doesn't make it credible or true.   


And your note about ""approximately 20 judges"" having looked at the case is just laughable. Names of the 20 would be a good start.    


You are also full of shit when you say that ""Many of them were interviewed by police and HEB offered a $50,000 reward and they said nothing about Stacey knowing Reed until he starts showing up on the Dr. Phil show and Kim Kardashian advocated for him...""  - Total bullshit. You have people going on the record all the way back to the first trial, and definitely by 2006.  

You have also gone from stating that Reed's DNA was on the back brace to now saying it was ""all over her body"".  FFS. 

And the reward that went unclaimed was for any information leading to the capture of  Stacy's killer - not a reward for people to say they knew Reed and Stacy were having an affair.  Again, reading comprehension is fundamental.

But you can't. There is no lab that tested the saliva on her breasts. If there is, show me a report or introduction of evidence into the trial.

Having the death penalty makes things go south and makes them notorious as well, imho.In Europe, horrible crimes do happen.

She has been sentenced to life imprisonment without parole for a minimum of 25 years. When released on parole, she will be over 60 years of age and will live a small life and keep her head down. No, you have not. We, on the other hand, have heard about some housewife from Texas called Darlie Routier (I'm Polish, btw).Why? Because she has been sentenced to death. And because, for whatever reason, cases like this always become a frenzied media circus in the US.Also, European newspapers need s.th to report on/file the last pages.

oucegr,h71fdxc,doggod,"BASTROP — The Rodney Reed hearing ended Thursday with prosecutors presenting witnesses in an effort to prove Reed had a history of violence toward women, including one who said he raped her in 1995. 

A defense attorney said the judge should not consider the rape testimony or the testimony of another woman who testified Thursday that Reed assaulted her in 1996, because Reed had not faced trial in either charge. 

Reed was convicted of capital murder in Stacey Stites' strangulation death in 1998 and received the death penalty. Stites' body was found by the side of a rural road in Bastrop County on April 23, 1996, with Reed's sperm in her. Before she died, Stites had planned to marry her fiancé, Jimmy Fennell, then a Giddings police officer.

Five days before Reed's scheduled execution in 2019, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals ordered that a hearing be held in state District Court in Bastrop after defense attorneys presented new evidence they said exonerated Reed.

Previously:Rodney Reed returns to court; dozens rally in Bastrop for his freedom

Stacey Stites
The hearing started July 19. Attorneys will have until Aug. 17 to write up proposed findings and conclusions of fact and then present them to the judge, said defense lawyer Andrew MacRae.

The lawyers will then make closing arguments to the judge, he said. District Judge J.D. Langley will them make his recommendations to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals on whether Reed should receive a new trial, be found innocent or be executed.

Langley said he plans to ask for an extension from the appeals court on the Aug. 31 deadline for his recommendations. Langley also said Thursday that he is still considering whether to use the testimony from the women who said Reed attacked them in his recommendations.

The woman who testified Thursday that Reed raped her said she met him on some railroad tracks after she had been drinking at a party in October 1995. She said she didn't know who Reed was when he pulled her under a railroad trestle and sexually assaulted her. Prosecutor Lisa Tanner said the DNA that the victim submitted after the attack matched Reed's DNA.

Another woman also testified Thursday that Reed punched her and dragged her by the hair on Nov. 9, 1996, after she agreed to give him a ride home after meeting him at a convenience store. She said she did not know him at the time but later identified him in a photo lineup. He asked her for oral sex and she refused, she said. 

""I responded you will have to kill me before you get anything from me,"" the woman said. ""He (Reed) said, 'I guess I will have to kill you.'"" 

The woman said she kept punching Reed until she was able to escape from the truck and run for help.

During the sentencing phase of his capital murder trial in 1998, prosecutors said Reed had been considered a suspect in sexual assaults of six other women. He was only charged in one case and was later acquitted. It is from one of those cases that police had Reed’s DNA on file when it was matched to DNA found on Stites’ body.

One of the defense lawyers, Jane Pucher, said after Thursday's hearing that the defense had brought forth ""very powerful evidence"" during the hearing that Reed had a consensual affair with Stites.

Several defense witnesses testified they had seen Stites with Reed before she died or had heard her talk about having an affair with a Black man. Reed is Black while Stites and Fennell are white. 

The defense witnesses also testified they had seen Stites and Fennell fighting or had heard Fennell saying derogatory things about Stites after she was killed. A defense witness also testified that Fennell made a remark while in prison about strangling a woman. 

Fennell was sentenced in 2008 to 10 years in prison for kidnapping and inappropriate conduct with a person in custody while a police officer in Georgetown. He testified at the hearing last week that he did not kill Stites and did not know Reed.

MacRae, the defense attorney, said after the hearing that the 15 to 20 defense witnesses who testified ""had no axe to grind, don't know Jimmy Fennell and don't know Rodney Reed."" 

Debra Oliver, one of Stites' sisters, cast doubt on the testimony of the defense witnesses after the hearing, saying sometimes distant memories are ""inaccurate."" 

Oliver also said in an interview outside the courtroom earlier Thursday that ""finally the truth is out"" that Stites did not have an affair with Reed.  

Stites' daughter, Demi Nugent, also said outside the courtroom Thursday that the hearing was ""a mess.""

""We shouldn't have to keep reliving it because we are the victims,"" she said. ""Stacey was the victim and not the other way around.""

One of Rodney Reed's brothers, Rodrick Reed, said after the hearing that defense attorneys had demonstrated that Rodney Reed did not kill Stites.

""We proved medically and scientifically that it was impossible for him to do this,"" saId Rodrick Reed. ""We are feeling pretty good. We are feeling positive about this."" 

Defense witnesses testified during the hearing that Stites died much earlier than the prosecution claimed, which would mean that she was with Fennell when she died.",5,1627614286.0,True,https://reddit.com/r/BastropTX/comments/oucegr/after_9_days_rodney_reed_hearing_closes_with/h71fdxc/,t3_oucegr,0

There is also the evidence of the sodomy and rape of a 12 year old in his past along with another rape of two women, all had DNA evidence that pointed to Rodney.

**So you have to believe that:**

1. Rodney is just raping and pillaging through life.  Leaving a wake of children and women in his path.
2. Rodney had two women and a 12 year old falsely accuse himself of rape, even though all have physical evidence linking him to them.  \*Cue sappy RomCom Music\* He moves to Bastrop to start a new in some RomCom format story. By pure charm he is able to woo a cop‘s bride-to-be to have a secret affair with him.  That lady is killed and he’s like “shucks”, he doesn’t come forward.  Then in a backslide moment (you know how those RomComs need some struggle for the protagonist), 3 months later he tries to abduct and rape another woman.  Because of that he is linked to Stacy’s rape and murder by DNA.  Then after multiple interviews by cops and only after they let him know they have his DNA inside of Stacy.  Then the whole relationship is laid bare for the world to see, only corroborated after his conviction by two family members. \*Cue RomCom Sappy Music, roll credits\*

I am personally glad Rodney is off the street.  If you know any children or women, you should be glad as well.

ope8ce,h65hayj,None,"No, because of this from the story:

>The state has always argued that Reed kidnapped and killed Stites between 3am and 5am as she drove to work from Giddings, where she lived with Fennell, to the H-E-B in Bastrop on the morning of April 23, 1996. They've also rebutted Reed's claim of an affair by insisting he and Stites did not know one another. Attorney Andrew MacRae, who has worked to free Reed for two decades, told the court in his opening statement that the new testimony will gut both of those claims and portray Fennell as eminently capable of murder.

>His first witness was Dr. Andrew Baker, a forensic pathologist from Minneapolis, who told the court that crime scene video of Stites' body showed that it was not in rigor mortis when it was first examined – meaning she died some time around 10pm the previous night, when she was alone with Fennell. Assistant Attorney General Lisa Tan­ner, who worked alongside Bastrop District Attorney Charles Penick to prosecute Reed in 1998, spent hours cross-examining Baker but mostly avoided questioning his technical claims, asking instead if it was odd that Stites was found murdered in her work uniform.

>Charles Wayne Fletcher, a former colleague of Fennell's at the Giddings Police Department, testified that Fennell told him before Stites' death of his suspicions that she was, as Fennell put it, ""fucking a n----r."" The phrase, spoken aloud, caused gasps in the courtroom; on cross­-examination, Fletcher said he never revealed what Fennell told him out of fear that he and his family would be targeted by police.

>Later on Monday, Ruby Volek testified that as she signed Stites up for life insurance, Fennell told his fiancée, ""If I ever catch you messing around on me, I will kill you and no one will ever know it was me that killed you."" Like Fletcher, Volek testified that she was nervous to tell anyone what she'd heard: ""I knew Jimmy a little bit and I was concerned that my life might be compromised.""

>Six more witnesses took the stand on Tuesday. Two testified that they'd seen Reed and Stites together; another claimed to have seen a fight between Stites and Fennell. Another spoke of Fennell staring into Stites' coffin at her funeral and saying, ""You got what you deserved."" The most dramatic testimony, though, came from two witnesses who met Fennell in prison.

>After Stites' death, Fennell took a job with the Georgetown Police Department. In 2008, he was charged with raping a woman in his custody and pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of kidnapping and sexual assault, for which he served 10 years in prison. Michael Bordelon testified he got to know Fennell at the Sanders Estes Unit, south of Ft. Worth; hearing about Stites, he asked Fennell to tell the story. ""I took care of the problem,"" Bordelon remembered Fennell telling him, as he simulated a strangling motion. ""I took care of her and that damn n----r is going to do the time.""

nre4vd,h0gk4ap,AutomaticPossibility,"I'm sorry, but although I agree OJ was guilty, Chauvin's trial was as fair as anyone elses.  I watched alot of it and listened while at work and he was not slighted in his defense.  He may have been convicted in the public eye before the trial began, but that was because the video evidence was pretty hard to overcome.  How can he explain away his actions from that day?  There is no logical reason to manhandle someone that way who is not putting up a fight, and is begging to be allowed to breathe.

I look at it like this.  A person in a position of power, whether a cop, president, or preacher, has a higher level of scrutiny and must live up to their position.  No one is perfect, but if you choose to be a preacher, then you have to try your best to live as God has instructed and when you slip, repent and ask forgiveness.  If you are president, then you ""should"" act with integrity and as a leader for your people.

When a cop is tasked with keeping people safe and enforcing the laws we have created for society, it is extremely important for them to be the example for those who may choose the unlawful path.  Sometimes they are in situations that are life threatening, and are (or should be trained) to react in the amount of force necessary to end the conflict.  

But in today's advancement of technology, everything a person does can be caught under the public microscope.  Literally EVERYONE knows this ahead of time.  We know we are being watched from all angles, and should act accordingly.  It should be even more important for those who hold a higher position in our society than the lay folks.  So no, Derek Chauvin did not get mistreated in his trial.  He was represented by an attorney who used the law to his best ability to defend him, and he was convicted by a jury of peers.  He acted in a way that no peace officer should act.  If his actions, which we actually have full evidence of, are allowed to be swept away under the rug because he is a cop, then what can we expect from those who care nothing of the laws that shape our society?",34,1622739298.0,False,https://reddit.com/r/TrueCrime/comments/nre4vd/ok_fellow_true_crime_enthusiasts_lots_of_cases/h0gk4ap/,t1_h0fyd1w,1

m9fg06,gs9ttz7,ssp92,"Understandable. It's a whole picture which makes a suspect. But is anything more damning than the rest? With Reed is obviously his DNA on the victim and items in the truck. 

It's very curious you believe him guilty of the other cases against him, but not this one. Usually Reed supporters say he is innocent of all of it; simply because if he is guilty of the rapes that proves motive. And with regards to the abduction of Lisa Schluter 6 months after the murder; even similar a MO in the same area from which Stacey was abducted. Or do you think is that one not true, but the others are?

With regards to the death penalty, I'm the opposite. I think it's rather backwards; but so is politicizing the case to make a guilty man go free when there'ss this much evidence against him. 

When I first heard of the case I didn't jump immediately to Reed being guilty. I was actually pretty torn on the physical evidence indicating both men; mainly Reed's saliva on her chest, and  the DNA matching two cops on beer cans. I then dug deeper into the court documents and found out that that they found even more of Reed's DNA in 2015; on the back brace found in the truck. I also found out that the beer cans were a red herring; there never was a match on the cops, just a wide ranging ""could not be excluded""; which is rather disingenuously being paraded around as a match by the media and Reed's supporters. A more thorough test ruled out both cops as the contributors to the DNA on the can.

m9fg06,gshlje0,LOBrienC-C,"That is incorrect.  The DNA on the beer cans was HLA-DQ Alpha, which is not unique, individualized DNA.  It's a genetic profile that unrelated people can share.  The HLA-DQ Alpha on one of the beer cans didn't exclude David Hall, Ed Salmela and Stacey Stites.  Reed's DNA expert, Dr. Elizabeth Johnson, performed further PCR testing on the swabs from the beer cans and actual developed profiles that excluded Hall, Salmela and Stites, rendering the beer cans irrelevant.  That's why they weren't testified about at Reed's trial in 1998.

To date, Reed's advocates have produced no evidence, or credible testimony of a relationship between Reed and Stacey (""everybody knew"" is not evidence) and the witnesses who provided affidavits in 2014/2015 were not called to testify at hearings in 2017.  Reed and his advocates have also never produced any credible, reliable evidence that would prove how Fennell could've traveled the 35 miles between Bastrop, where Stacey's body and the truck were dumped, and Giddings, where he and Stacey lived and where he was present when Carol Stites was notified that Stacey didn't make it to work at around 7:00 a.m.  There was also evidence admitted at trial that Stacey's body could not have been dumped earlier than 4:00 a.m., so moving her time of death back doesn't really change the timeline.

The DNA evidence excludes Fennell.  There is, in fact, no credible, reliable evidence that proves Fennell is the ""real killer.""  

One of the factors working against the current witnesses to allegedly inculpatory statements by Fennell is their failure to report these statement to the original investigators during the murder investigation.

But, we should probably move on, as were going in circles, but If you like evidence and common sense, I want to pick your brain on the following inconsistency in Reed's testimony.

Why was Reed lying about Stacey being a drug user?In the 2006 documentary “State vs Reed”, Reed made the following statement about Stacey:*“I remember, there was a time, where Stacey, she would come with marijuana and wanted me to trade it for cocaine, crack cocaine. “*  \[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLTcV664IgU&feature=emb\_title&ab\_channel=RyanPolomski](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLTcV664IgU&feature=emb_title&ab_channel=RyanPolomski) \- Timecode approx. 50:49-51:05\]

Hair sample analysis however, did not reveal Stacey to be a user of cocaine. Likewise was her H.E.B employment drug screening negative for any drugs.

*“Regarding the allegation of Stacey's crack cocaine use with Reed, the trial judge found that the toxicology report from Stacey's autopsy was negative for drugs and alcohol. The drug screen conducted by H.E.B. before Stacey was hired was also negative. Further, the trial judge found: Prior to trial, the State sent samples of Stacey Stites' hair to National Medical Services, Inc. in Pennsylvania. That laboratory analyzed 32 centimeters of her hair in order to determine whether cocaine or its metabolites were present. As that laboratory's report indicates, two different analyses were negative for cocaine. Since hair grows at an approximate rate of one centimeter per month, the State was prepared, through the use of these analyses, to prove that Stacey Stites was not a cocaine user for the last 32 months of her life.”* \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/Docket...20180201153354587\_Rodney Reed -- Appendix.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf) \- page 179a\]",1,1620145012.0,False,https://reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/m9fg06/rodney_reed_supporters_hold_rally_at_bastrop/gwx89dt/,t1_gwx5ex1,4

k9zbbe,gfjjgq4,sammytheammonite,"I’m late to the party, but here’s my thoughts (copied from a previous write up of mine):

There is no new evidence in the Reed case. A couple people coming forward after TWENTY YEARS of silence isn’t valid evidence. The defense that it was consensual was presented at his original trial, and the jury didn’t find it viable. He has NEVER testified at trial about a consensual relationship. 

What we do know, and what has already been presented to the courts:

Stacey was wearing her HEB shirt, work shoes, work pants and name tag when she was abducted, raped and murdered. This highly suggests she was abducted on her way to work that morning. They found semen in her underwear that was bunched by her hips. That semen matched Reed. They also found semen in her vagina. Matched Reed. They found saliva DNA on her chest - also matched Reed (wouldn’t survive a shower). In 2014, the pants she was wearing - her work pants, were tested. DNA matched Reed. This places him near the body on the day she died. They also tested the back brace in her truck. DNA on that also matched Reed - placing him near the Truck when she died.

Stacey was strangled and sodomized. Reed has a history of violence and rape (victims testified at his trial and his DNA was a match to three other open rape cases with similar MOs). That history included strangling his victims with belts or articles of clothing and sodomizing them, including a 12 year old girl, who had Reed’s DNA inside her vagina. 

Stacey had bruises on her arm consistent with being held forcibly. Trauma on her head consistent with knuckles. Injuries to her anus consistent with sodomy. Her HEB shirt was ripped off her body. He underwear with semen in them was bunched at her hips. Her work pants were forcibly removed, breaking the zipper. One work shoe was found by her body, the other in the truck. All of this suggests rape and murder the morning she left for work. Her own mother heard her leave for work that morning, and testified to this effect and had never waivers from her account. 

The truck was left at Bastrop High School after dumping her body. This is over 30 miles away from Stacey’s house and only walking distance from Reed’s home. He was known to walk in that area and even picked up other victims near this same area. The seat was set at a position consistent with Reed’s height. Not Stacey’s. And not Jimmy’s. The seat belt was still fastened, suggesting that Stacey was pulled from the driver’s seat forcibly. 

The beer cans were tested by his own defense team and they ruled out Hall, Selmena and Stacey as contributors. The idea that the beer cans weren’t tested is not true. The idea that these two cops were a match is not true. This is a false narrative perpetuated by Reed’s supporters.

In the time between Stacey’s death and Reed’s arrest (11 months), his name never came up as a boyfriend, friend or acquaintance. Not once. Not by anyone at all. When Reed was first questioned, he denied knowing her. Over and over again. It was only after he was presented with the DNA evidence that he changes his story and claimed a secret sexual relationship. The only other time he claimed this was in a separate rape case 10 years prior - used the same excise as his defense. However, he consistently dated white women, openly. Never in secret. Never hidden. The mother of his children is white. The only time he claimed secret relationships because of racial tensions was when he was accused of rape. Twice. 

I don’t know how you can hear this evidence in full and think anyone other than Reed is responsible for this crime.

People calling for his release, without doing any due diligence on understanding the case, are causing harm.",154,1607788826.0,False,https://reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/k9zbbe/kim_kardashian_and_other_celebs_believe_rodney/gfjjgq4/,t3_k9zbbe,0
k9zbbe,gfaogsl,DJHJR86,"Kim Kardashian and others are severely misinformed about this case.  I would also suggest not relying so much on the Innocence Project, [because](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3276185) the vast majority of convictions are just.

> This Article disputes that conventional wisdom. Based on a careful review of the available empirical literature, it is possible to assemble the component parts of a wrongful conviction rate calculation by looking at error rates at trial, the ratio of wrongful convictions obtained through trials versus plea bargains, and the percentage of cases resolved through pleas. **Combining empirically based estimates for each of these three factors, a reasonable (and possibly overstated) calculation of the wrongful conviction rate appears, tentatively, to be somewhere in the range of 0.016%–0.062% — a range that comfortably embraces Justice Scalia’s oftencriticized figure.**

Now, with regards to Rodney Reed, the [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/45899/20180507150103836_Reed%20BIO%20FINAL.pdf) looked into his claims of innocence and found:

> Indeed, Reed’s actual innocence “claim” has been reviewed repeatedly—and repeatedly rejected. The CCA has done
so on multiple occasions. Moreover, Reed’s newest theory of innocence, including the supposed retraction from Dr. Bayardo and the opinions of Drs. Baden and Spitz, has also been found insufficient. Reed has been given the opportunity to be heard on his actual innocence “claim,” but he has simply failed to prove it. There is nothing fundamentally unfair in the repeated, in-depth review Reed has been afforded of his actual innocence ""claim.""

> Moreover, the State disagrees with the factual basis for Reed’s actual innocence “claim”, and it is Reed’s unspoken reason for a writ of certiorari. As to Dr. Bayardo’s “recantation,” two federal courts have disagreed with Reed’s word choice, finding little difference between his trial testimony and affidavit. As to Reed’s new time of death estimate, opining that Stites died earlier than estimated, it is curious given that Reed has tried to push back Stites’s time of death through supposedly reliable eyewitnesses, and he has offered other expert testimony that no reliable time of death could be estimated in this case. **In other words, as soon as a court debunks one theory of innocence, he simply offers another.**

> **As to Fennell, whatever might be said about him, it pales in comparison with Reed’s history of violent sexual assault, assaults sharing many similarities with Stites’s murder—many victims were Stites’s age or very near; many were abused in Bastrop; a couple were raped or abducted close in time to Stite's murder; many were subjected to anal or attempted anal rape; and all but one were subjected to physical violence in addition to rape or attempted rape. Ultimately, Reed must have a compelling reason for why his semen was inside a murdered woman.** 

His case hinges on the fact that he had a consensual relationship with Stacey.  Because if he didn't, he is guilty.  And, for Reed to be innocent, he would have had to have had anal and vaginal sex with Stacey **two days** (his own admission) prior to her murder, and then have her be murdered by someone else (Fennell or someone unknown) who staged a rape to throw off the investigation.  This murderer was also lucky enough to kill a woman who did not shower or bath for two days.  And he would also have to explain why he denied ever knowing Stacey Stites until confronted with the fact that his semen was found on and inside of her.  

And let's not forget that it wasn't just Stacey Stites.

> **The rape and murder of Stites was hardly Reed’s first or last foray against women.** First was Connie York, a nineteen-year-old who had come home late one evening after swimming with friends. York was grabbed from behind and told “don’t scream or I’ll hurt you.”  When York did not listen, she was repeatedly struck, dragged to her bedroom, and raped multiple times. Reed was interviewed, and, while he admitted that he knew York from high school, he denied raping her. **When confronted with a search warrant for biological samples, Reed had an about-face, “Yeah, I had sex with her, she wanted it.”**

> Next was A.W., **a twelve-year-old girl**, who was home alone, having fallen asleep on a couch after watching TV. A.W. awoke when someone began pushing her face into the couch and had blindfolded and gagged her. **She was repeatedly hit in the head, called vulgar names, and orally, vaginally, and anally raped. The foreign DNA from A.W.’s rape kit was compared to Reed; Reed was not excluded and only one in 5.5 billion people would have the same foreign DNA profile from A.W.’s rape kit.**

> Then came Lucy Eipper, who Reed had met in high school, and whom Reed began to date after her graduation. Eipper had two children with Reed. **Throughout their relationship, Reed physically abused Eipper, including while she was pregnant, and raped her “all the time,” including one time in front of their two children.**

> Afterwards, Reed began dating Caroline Rivas, **an intellectually disabled woman**. Rivas’s caseworker noticed bruises on Rivas’s body and, when asked about them, Rivas admitted that Reed would hurt her if she would not have sex with him. **Later, Rivas’s caseworker noticed that Rivas was walking oddly and sat down gingerly. Rivas admitted that Reed had, the prior evening, hit her, called her vulgar names, and anally raped her. The samples from Rivas’s rape kit provided the link to Stites’s murder.**

> **Shortly thereafter, and about six months before Stites’s murder, Reed raped Vivian Harbottle underneath a train trestle as she was walking home. When she pleaded for her life for the sake of her children, Reed laughed at her. The foreign DNA from Harbottle’s rape kit was compared to Reed; he could not be excluded, and only one person in 5.5 billion would be expected to have the same foreign DNA profile.**

> Finally, and about six months after Stites’s murder, Reed convinced nineteen-year-old Linda Schlueter to give him a ride home at about 3:30 a.m. **Reed led her to a remote area and then attacked her. After a prolonged struggle, Schlueter asked Reed what he wanted and Reed responded, “I want a blow job.” When Schlueter told Reed that “you will have to kill me before you get anything,” Reed stated “I guess I’ll have to kill you then.” Before Schlueter could be raped, a car drove by and Reed fled.**

Kind of odd that Kim Kardashian and the Innocence Project forget to mention all of that.

k9zbbe,gfo1anu,ssp92,"Reed is guilty - the innocence project is leaving out incriminating details about their client.

a)  At trial, the jury was aware of intact spermatozoa DNA in the victim, as well as saliva DNA on her breasts – further confirmed by tests performed by the defense’s own expert, Dr. Johnson.

Emphasis mine:

*“Dr. Johnson's DQ–Alpha* ***testing on the saliva from breast swabs taken by Blakley yielded the same results as the previous testing conducted by DPS***\*. On the swab taken from Stacey's left breast, testing indicated 1.2, 4.1, and 3 alleles, and on the swab taken from Stacey right breast, testing indicated 1.2, 3, and 4.1 alleles.\* ***Dr. Johnson conceded that in all of the sixteen sites tested in this case, Reed could not be excluded as the donor of the semen and saliva found on Stacey's body.”*** \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587\_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf) \- page 122a\]

*“Dr. Johnson identified the substance as* ***saliva based on an amylase test***\*. Amylase is a primary component of saliva, according to Dr. Johnson. Dr. Johnson stated that\* ***it was likely that the saliva got there after Stacey's last shower***\*, which was the night before she was murdered\*.” \[[https://law.justia.com/cases/texas/court-of-criminal-appeals/2008/17748.html](https://law.justia.com/cases/texas/court-of-criminal-appeals/2008/17748.html)\]

New testing done in 2014 also showed Reed’s DNA from touch mixed with the victim’s on her back-brace found in the truck, as well as her pants. \[[https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808\_99b68a76d3144c4faac8375a404f376d.pdf](https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808_99b68a76d3144c4faac8375a404f376d.pdf) \- page 11\]

Emphasis mine:

*“Reed also could not be excluded, using Y-STR analysis, from three* ***vaginal swabs, a rectal swab, Stites’s panties, vaginalswab sticks, a vaginal sperm-search slide***\*, and\* ***extracts of stains found on Stites’s back brace, pants, and a breast swab***\*.

b) Reed lied about not knowing Stacey Stites initially. Then came up with the secret affair defense at trial, only after being presented with the DNA evidence. \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587\_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf)  \- page 207a\] The argument that he was afraid of admitting to the interracial relationship in small-town racist Bastrop, holds no water, seeing as in 1996, Reed had already had two children with Lucy Eipper, also a white woman. \[[https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808\_88cb22cd079e4d3f8c9c6e9c5dccf1ae.pdf](https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808_88cb22cd079e4d3f8c9c6e9c5dccf1ae.pdf) \- page 20\]

c) Tests of Jimmy Fennell’s truck, where the prosecution theorizes part of the attack took place, found that a person around 6 feet, 2 was the last driver of the vehicle based on the height of the seat in relation to the mirrors. Reed is 6 feet, 2. \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587\_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf) \- page 4a-5a, 26a, [https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808\_ff1ce06e53b44745b718717fae875c2b.pdf](https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808_ff1ce06e53b44745b718717fae875c2b.pdf) \- page 43\]

d) Jimmy Fennell’s Truck was found in the Bastrop High School parking lot, about sixth-tenths of a mile, approximately a 15-minute walk, from Reed’s residence at the time of the murder. \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587\_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf) \- page 116a, 207a\]

e) Police often saw Reed on the route Stites would drive for work, in the early hours of the morning. One officer testified that it would be a regular occurrence for him to see Reed in 1995-1997, between 9:00pm and 3:00am in the area. \[[https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/50\_reporters-record\_jury-trial-guilt-innocence-afternoon-session\_volume-50-of-69.pdf](https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/50_reporters-record_jury-trial-guilt-innocence-afternoon-session_volume-50-of-69.pdf) \- page 70\]

f) Unbeknownst to the Jury at trial, Reed became a suspect under very incriminating circumstances. About 6 months after the Stites murder; a woman named Linda Schluter went to police after a tall black man tried to sexually assault her and stole her car, at around 3am in Bastrop. \[[https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808\_26423e4169d34d57b5daba08aca49852.pdf](https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808_26423e4169d34d57b5daba08aca49852.pdf) \- page 44-47\] Based on her description of the perpetrator, as well the area the attack took place, where police had often seen Reed in those early hours, they zeroed in on Reed and Schlueter picked him out of a photo lineup. Because of the similarities with the Stites case police thought Reed a likely suspect: in addition to the attack taking place around the same time and area, Schlueter’s vehicle was also dumped in close proximity to Reed’s residence. \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/45899/20180507150103836\_Reed%20BIO%20FINAL.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/45899/20180507150103836_Reed%20BIO%20FINAL.pdf) \- page 5, 8\] It was at this time law enforcement thought to match the DNA found in the Stites murder with Reed. Reed did not become a suspect in the Stites case until late February, early march of 1997. \[[https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/46\_reporters-record\_jury-trial-guilt-innocence-phase-afternoon-session\_volume-46-of-69.pdf](https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/46_reporters-record_jury-trial-guilt-innocence-phase-afternoon-session_volume-46-of-69.pdf) \- page 122\]",13,1607848824.0,False,https://reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/k9zbbe/kim_kardashian_and_other_celebs_believe_rodney/gfo1anu/,t3_k9zbbe,0

There are quite a few pieces of evidence that have come to light over the years and new witnesses have come forward. This way or way not result in a new trial. However I think the most promising angle for Reed is having his death sentences vacated and being resentenced to life instead. This being based on the fact that the prosecution used cases he has already been aquitted of as an argument for the death penalty. They said since he was accused of similar crimes hes a continued threat. Thats all well and good but there was an actual trial that resulted in aquittal on one of those charges. So bringing that case up as part of the sentencing hearing could be seen as double jeopardy, basically retrying that case.

k9zbbe,gfd7xzo,amador9,"I personally abhor the death penalty even if the condemned prisoner is completely guilty.  I have no idea if the people who advocate for Rodney really believe he is innocent of the murder of Stacy Stites or if they have just concluded that the best way to garner support and generate contributions is to portray him as factually innocent. At his trial, the defense’s claim that he had been in a “ secret relationship” with Stacey seemed laughable; particularly since he used a similar defense in an earlier rape case.  As in many high profile “wrongful conviction” cases, long after the trial, some folks have come forward with unverifiable claims that point towards innocence.  It is easy to be skeptical.

If Rodney really is innocent, the fact read like something out of lame crime fiction:  A serial rapist (and Rodney is a serial rapist) who has managed to fly under Law Enforcement radar, is having a down low relationship with a White Cop’s girlfriend.  On a night after the girlfriend had sex with Rodney, the Cop murders her; perhaps because he found out she was seeing a Black Guy.  The Cop dumps her body near her place of employment, parks her car nearby, and stages it all to look like a rape on the way to work.  The unidentified male DNA is retained. 

Months later, Rodney does yet another rape and the DNA from that rape is matched to that from Stacey’s case.  Then, Rodney’s DNA is taken due to another felony arrest and it is match to the recent rape and Stacey’s murder.  Poor, pitiful Rodney gets the Death penalty.

k9zbbe,gfabji6,non_ducor_duco_,"I have two questions:

1. With the time of death now thought to be earlier than originally determined, how does that fit in with others accounts of when Stacey was last known to be alive (others as in not her fiancée)? Is it known she was alive and at home the night before she died? [This article](https://www.kvue.com/mobile/article/news/local/rodney-reed-texas-death-row-stacey-stites/269-83d1b2d1-8db2-412f-aae2-afbda9128e48) says she and her fiancé lived in an apartment above her moms residence. It further mentions that Stacey and her mom had spoken the day before she died, but it doesn’t say if it was in person or on the phone. Did mom see her the night before she died? Was mom home all night? If so, did she hear anything amiss? If the theory is that the fiancée killed her in the apartment and mom was home the whole time I have a really hard time believing she heard nothing.

2. Is there anything that tied Reed to Stacey other than a cousin / coworker of Stacey’s later coming forward to say she was having an affair with him? I know that cell phones weren’t common back then, but I would think there would have to be some communication between the two via landline or pager (if one had a pager).

k9zbbe,gfo36g0,ssp92,"1. Jim Clampit loses credibly by his failure to report said Fennell's incriminating remark in 1996. Being an officer of the law it's highly problematic he did not disclose this information so long ago.
2. Yes, they are refusing to test the belt, for good reasons too. Reed’s counsel has routinely failed to prove how testing the belt could be potentially exculpatory for their client. The belt in question has been cross contaminated over the years due to improper storage, likewise was it handled ungloved by the jury and the defense at the trial. \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/45899/20180507150103836\_Reed%20BIO%20FINAL.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/45899/20180507150103836_Reed%20BIO%20FINAL.pdf) \- page 25\] No one knew in 1998 that touch DNA would be thing, which is the reason the belt was handled ungloved and likewise why it went untested originally. Modern high sensitivity DNA testing is also another reason the State is refusing to test the belt. Justice Alito put it best:

Emphasis mine:

***“\[M\]odern DNA testing is so powerful that it actually increases the risks associated with mishandling evidence***\*. STR tests, for example, are so sensitive that they can detect DNA transferred from person X to a towel (with which he wipes his face), from the towel to Y (who subsequently wipes his face), and from Y’s face to a murder weapon later wielded by Z (who can use STR technology to blame X for the murder).\* ***Any test that is sensitive enough to pick up such trace amounts of DNA will be able to detect even the lightest, unintentional mishandling of evidence. . . . . Then, after conviction, with nothing to lose, the defendant could demand DNA testing in the hope that some happy accident—for example, degradation or contamination of the evidence—would provide the basis for seeking postconviction relief. Denying the opportunity for such an attempt to game the criminal justice system should not shock the conscience of the Court”***

\[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/45899/20180507150103836\_Reed%20BIO%20FINAL.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/45899/20180507150103836_Reed%20BIO%20FINAL.pdf) \- page 26\]

Because of the mishandling of the belt, there’s a very high chance tests will find DNA from an unknown male, and that Reed’s counsel will use this find to muddy the waters further, saying that the DNA is from the real perpetrator. Should they strike gold and get a DNA match on Jimmy Fennell it would be easy to dispel for the prosecution, seeing as he lived with the victim, therefore finding his DNA on her belt would be pretty likely. Same argument goes for the defense, should more of Reed’s DNA be found on the belt, seeing as they claim a secret relationship between him and the victim. Testing the belt would not have changed the outcome of the original trial, because of all the other DNA evidence against Reed. It’s up to Reed’s counsel to prove otherwise, before tests can be carried out.

Also, it’s important to note that the State agreed to DNA tests on reasonable, uncontaminated and previously untested items in 2014 - and that these tests found even more of Reed’s DNA, in the form touch DNA, further dispelling the theory that the state is hiding something. \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/45899/20180507150103836\_Reed%20BIO%20FINAL.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/45899/20180507150103836_Reed%20BIO%20FINAL.pdf)  \- page 13, [https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808\_99b68a76d3144c4faac8375a404f376d.pdf](https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808_99b68a76d3144c4faac8375a404f376d.pdf) \- page 4-5\]

Reed’s counsel has also failed to prove that their requests for testing items found anywhere near the crime scene, including a paper napkin found near the truck, is nothing more than a stall tactic in order to delay Reed’s execution.

*“Like the beer cans and condoms, Reed cannot demonstrate the relevance of the napkin, much less that its testing and the attending exculpatory result injects sufficient doubt into the evidentiary mix that a jury would acquit.”*

k9zbbe,gfo8imt,ssp92,"  

Yes, they are refusing to test the belt, for good reasons too. Reed’s counsel has routinely failed to prove how testing the belt could be potentially exculpatory for their client. The belt in question has been cross contaminated over the years due to improper storage, likewise was it handled ungloved by the jury and the defense at the trial. \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/45899/20180507150103836\_Reed%20BIO%20FINAL.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/45899/20180507150103836_Reed%20BIO%20FINAL.pdf) \- page 25\] No one knew in 1998 that touch DNA would be thing, which is the reason the belt was handled ungloved and likewise why it went untested originally. Modern high sensitivity DNA testing is also another reason the State is refusing to test the belt. Justice Alito put it best: 

Emphasis mine: 

***“\[M\]odern DNA testing is so powerful that it actually increases the risks associated with mishandling evidence****. STR tests, for example, are so sensitive that they can detect DNA transferred from person X to a towel (with which he wipes his face), from the towel to Y (who subsequently wipes his face), and from Y’s face to a murder weapon later wielded by Z (who can use STR technology to blame X for the murder).* ***Any test that is sensitive enough to pick up such trace amounts of DNA will be able to detect even the lightest, unintentional mishandling of evidence. . . . .

Because of the mishandling of the belt, there’s a very high chance tests will find DNA from an unknown male, and that Reed’s counsel will use this find to muddy the waters further, saying that the DNA is from the real perpetrator. Should they strike gold and get a DNA match on Jimmy Fennell it would be easy to dispel for the prosecution, seeing as he lived with the victim, therefore finding his DNA on her belt would be pretty likely. Same argument goes for the defense, should more of Reed’s DNA be found on the belt, seeing as they claim a secret relationship between him and the victim. Testing the belt would not have changed the outcome of the original trial, because of all the other DNA evidence against Reed. It’s up to Reed’s counsel to prove otherwise, before tests can be carried out. 

Also, it’s important to note that the State agreed to DNA tests on reasonable, uncontaminated and previously untested items in 2014 - and that these tests found even more of Reed’s DNA, in the form touch DNA, further dispelling the theory that the state is hiding something. \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/45899/20180507150103836\_Reed%20BIO%20FINAL.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/45899/20180507150103836_Reed%20BIO%20FINAL.pdf)  \- page 13, [https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808\_99b68a76d3144c4faac8375a404f376d.pdf](https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808_99b68a76d3144c4faac8375a404f376d.pdf) \- page 4-5\] 

Reed’s counsel has also failed to prove that their requests for testing items found anywhere near the crime scene, including a paper napkin found near the truck, is nothing more than a stall tactic in order to delay Reed’s execution. 

*“Like the beer cans and condoms, Reed cannot demonstrate the relevance of the napkin, much less that its testing and the attending exculpatory result injects sufficient doubt into the evidentiary mix that a jury would acquit.”*

The investigators then got a match on Reed, and the State of Texas instead decided to pursue the bigger case and the death penalty. It was during this time they also got DNA matches on Reed in the Vivian Harbottle and Angela Weiss rape cases, which happened prior to the Stites murder. 

The prior sexual assaults were used in the punishment phase of Reed’s trial, meaning the witnesses and DNA met the standard of evidence, and the defense had the option to cross-examine the witnesses, making their testimony more than just hearsay.

I’d say it’s pretty convenient that the guy who claims to have been having an affair with Stacey had a history of violence that matches what happened to Stacey. Especially considering no one knew of that history until 11 months AFTER her death. Pretty hard to frame someone using their MO when you don’t even know their MO yet. It’s much more likely that Reed is the guilty party. Fennel is indeed a POS, but not nearly as much as Reed. Fennel raped someone once 10 years later.

I actually got like 20k karma out of a thread I made about how it's bizarre that she's the world's pre-eminent sex symbol and somehow has an atrocious body. Like no e-standards, she is objectively unattractive. It's the bum implants. They make her appear grotesque, with little sticklegs coming out of a huge dumpy shapeless mass.

But I also think she's bright af, you don't turn a sex tape into a billion dollar empire with no savvy. And I've heard some comments out of character before that impressed the fuck out of me. Defending her husband's right to have his own opinions.

Fuck what was the point of this. Oh yea, I doubt she picks any of these cases. Probably just lends her name to the cause, so fair enough. I generally think the law gets it right though.

k9zbbe,gfo1zji,ssp92,"It's a misconception that Fennell's story about his whereabouts on the night of the murder is inconsistent. It has been debunked in court already, yet the innocence project continues to peddle this lie.

The misconception that Fennell changed his story comes stems a 2016 CNN interview, with Fennell’s friend Curtis Davis. In the interview Davis, stated that he thought, the reason why Fennell did not drive Stacey to work the night of the murder as planned, was because Fennell had been out drinking with friends after he finished up with his little league coaching duties. \[[https://edition.cnn.com/2017/09/11/us/texas-rodney-reed-hearing-death-row-stories-new-evidence/index.html](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/09/11/us/texas-rodney-reed-hearing-death-row-stories-new-evidence/index.html) \- page 31-33\]

This is Davis’ recollection of an event, he wasn’t a direct witness too, and over 20 years after it happened, in fact he specifically says that he doesn’t know and that he is guessing about the time frame: *“I don’t know how – what time. I mean uh, if was to ask me a direct question about what time they got that night, I couldn’t answer that, ‘cause I don’t know that I was ever told. But it was later that night after practice. So um, I assume definitely 10:00’ish 11:00 maybe at night”*

It is also directly contradicted by Carol Stites’ 1998 trial testimony in which she states that Fennell came to her apartment, on the evening of April 22th, 1996. Carol Stites says Fennell came to collect Stacey and they talked briefly, before Stacey and he left, going upstairs to their apartment. She also stated that to her knowledge Fennell stayed there all evening, and did not leave until the next morning, when she called him about Stacey not showing up for work.

Fennell has always stated that he was home and asleep at the time of the murder and the he did not see or hear Stacey leave. \[[https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/45\_reporters-record\_jury-trial-guilt-innocence-morning-session\_volume-45-of-69-2.pdf](https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/45_reporters-record_jury-trial-guilt-innocence-morning-session_volume-45-of-69-2.pdf) \- page 84\] If he was lying, he could easily have made up a better story, seeing as there was no one around to dispute his story: He could have said that he saw Stacey in her work uniform and that he spoke with her before she left for work at 3am.

Second, it is not a fact that Rodney Reed had a consensual relationship with Stacey Stites.

Alicia Slater was interviewed twice by police in the immediate aftermath of Stites' murder and did not say one single word about the conversation she supposedly had with Stites about Reed.

/u/DJHJR86 wrote an amazing comment down the line


Kim Kardashian and others are severely misinformed about this case.  I would also suggest not relying so much on the Innocence Project, [because](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3276185) the vast majority of convictions are just.

> This Article disputes that conventional wisdom. Based on a careful review of the available empirical literature, it is possible to assemble the component parts of a wrongful conviction rate calculation by looking at error rates at trial, the ratio of wrongful convictions obtained through trials versus plea bargains, and the percentage of cases resolved through pleas. **Combining empirically based estimates for each of these three factors, a reasonable (and possibly overstated) calculation of the wrongful conviction rate appears, tentatively, to be somewhere in the range of 0.016%–0.062% — a range that comfortably embraces Justice Scalia’s oftencriticized figure.**

Now, with regards to Rodney Reed, the [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/45899/20180507150103836_Reed%20BIO%20FINAL.pdf) looked into his claims of innocence and found:

> Indeed, Reed’s actual innocence “claim” has been reviewed repeatedly—and repeatedly rejected. The CCA has done
so on multiple occasions. Moreover, Reed’s newest theory of innocence, including the supposed retraction from Dr. Bayardo and the opinions of Drs. Baden and Spitz, has also been found insufficient. Reed has been given the opportunity to be heard on his actual innocence “claim,” but he has simply failed to prove it. There is nothing fundamentally unfair in the repeated, in-depth review Reed has been afforded of his actual innocence ""claim.""

> Moreover, the State disagrees with the factual basis for Reed’s actual innocence “claim”, and it is Reed’s unspoken reason for a writ of certiorari. As to Dr. Bayardo’s “recantation,” two federal courts have disagreed with Reed’s word choice, finding little difference between his trial testimony and affidavit. As to Reed’s new time of death estimate, opining that Stites died earlier than estimated, it is curious given that Reed has tried to push back Stites’s time of death through supposedly reliable eyewitnesses, and he has offered other expert testimony that no reliable time of death could be estimated in this case. **In other words, as soon as a court debunks one theory of innocence, he simply offers another.**

> **As to Fennell, whatever might be said about him, it pales in comparison with Reed’s history of violent sexual assault, assaults sharing many similarities with Stites’s murder—many victims were Stites’s age or very near; many were abused in Bastrop; a couple were raped or abducted close in time to Stite's murder; many were subjected to anal or attempted anal rape; and all but one were subjected to physical violence in addition to rape or attempted rape. Ultimately, Reed must have a compelling reason for why his semen was inside a murdered woman.** 

His case hinges on the fact that he had a consensual relationship with Stacey.  Because if he didn't, he is guilty.  And, for Reed to be innocent, he would have had to have had anal and vaginal sex with Stacey **two days** (his own admission) prior to her murder, and then have her be murdered by someone else (Fennell or someone unknown) who staged a rape to throw off the investigation.  This murderer was also lucky enough to kill a woman who did not shower or bath for two days.  And he would also have to explain why he denied ever knowing Stacey Stites until confronted with the fact that his semen was found on and inside of her.  

And let's not forget that it wasn't just Stacey Stites.

> **The rape and murder of Stites was hardly Reed’s first or last foray against women.** First was Connie York, a nineteen-year-old who had come home late one evening after swimming with friends. York was grabbed from behind and told “don’t scream or I’ll hurt you.”  When York did not listen, she was repeatedly struck, dragged to her bedroom, and raped multiple times. Reed was interviewed, and, while he admitted that he knew York from high school, he denied raping her. **When confronted with a search warrant for biological samples, Reed had an about-face, “Yeah, I had sex with her, she wanted it.”**

> Next was A.W., **a twelve-year-old girl**, who was home alone, having fallen asleep on a couch after watching TV. A.W. awoke when someone began pushing her face into the couch and had blindfolded and gagged her. **She was repeatedly hit in the head, called vulgar names, and orally, vaginally, and anally raped. The foreign DNA from A.W.’s rape kit was compared to Reed; Reed was not excluded and only one in 5.5 billion people would have the same foreign DNA profile from A.W.’s rape kit.**

> Then came Lucy Eipper, who Reed had met in high school, and whom Reed began to date after her graduation. Eipper had two children with Reed. **Throughout their relationship, Reed physically abused Eipper, including while she was pregnant, and raped her “all the time,” including one time in front of their two children.**

> Afterwards, Reed began dating Caroline Rivas, **an intellectually disabled woman**. Rivas’s caseworker noticed bruises on Rivas’s body and, when asked about them, Rivas admitted that Reed would hurt her if she would not have sex with him. **Later, Rivas’s caseworker noticed that Rivas was walking oddly and sat down gingerly. Rivas admitted that Reed had, the prior evening, hit her, called her vulgar names, and anally raped her. The samples from Rivas’s rape kit provided the link to Stites’s murder.**

> **Shortly thereafter, and about six months before Stites’s murder, Reed raped Vivian Harbottle underneath a train trestle as she was walking home. When she pleaded for her life for the sake of her children, Reed laughed at her. The foreign DNA from Harbottle’s rape kit was compared to Reed; he could not be excluded, and only one person in 5.5 billion would be expected to have the same foreign DNA profile.**

> Finally, and about six months after Stites’s murder, Reed convinced nineteen-year-old Linda Schlueter to give him a ride home at about 3:30 a.m. **Reed led her to a remote area and then attacked her. After a prolonged struggle, Schlueter asked Reed what he wanted and Reed responded, “I want a blow job.” When Schlueter told Reed that “you will have to kill me before you get anything,” Reed stated “I guess I’ll have to kill you then.” Before Schlueter could be raped, a car drove by and Reed fled.**

Kind of odd that Kim Kardashian and the Innocence Project forget to mention all of that.

It'll answer all your questions. No point in me answering because you'll probably have follow ups. 

Here's the part about the blunt force trauma:

 In June 2013, with the financial and administrative help of the NAACP and SCLC, the Johnson family arranged for the exhumation of Kendrick’s body for an independent autopsy to be performed by private pathologist Dr. William Anderson. It was during this autopsy when it was famously found that Kendrick’s organs were missing and his body stuffed with newspaper. The state of Georgia determined that though not the best practice, filling body cavities with newspaper isn’t illegal and the funeral home [broke no laws](http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/16/us/kendrick-johnson-funeral-home-probe/). Regardless, the Johnsons decided to sue the funeral home. During this second autopsy Dr. Anderson disputed the GBI’s findings and determined that Kendrick died of [“blunt force trauma, right neck.”](http://valdosta.sgaonline.com/2010vdt/pdfs/KJohnson_second_autopsy.pdf) How did he come to that conclusion? From a 2-3 centimeter bruise. [That’s it.](http://www.ajc.com/videos/news/raw-video-chief-medical-examiner-on-kendrick/vCGqSj/) No broken neck or throat bones, no signs of internal exsanguination, just a tiny bruise measuring less than an inch in length. And this is apparently the first and only time in history that this injury has been a cause of death. It’s important to point out that [Dr. Anderson does not claim that Kendrick was beaten](http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/highschool/2015/03/05/brian-bell-florida-state-kendrick-johnson-valdosta-lowndes-high-grand-jury/24432415/). He has never stated that Kendrick’s facial injuries are from anything other than skin slippage due to his position. The only people claiming that Kendrick was beaten to death are the Johnsons and their supporters. And for what it’s worth, Dr. Anderson is now a private pathologist after being fired from the state of Florida for a myriad of unprofessional and unethical actions on his part.",42,1607587851.0,False,https://reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/k9zbbe/kim_kardashian_and_other_celebs_believe_rodney/gf9cjoo/,t1_gf9ayav,4

A former cantor at Temple Emanu-El in Manhattan was sentenced yesterday to 12 years’ probation for sexually assaulting his nephew during visits to the boy’s home in Pennsylvania in the 1990’s.

Howard Nevison wasn't arrested until 2002. The events happened in the 1990s.  It took 4 years after the investigation (1998) to even have the arrest.

""Uncle Howie is better known to New Yorkers as Cantor Howard Nevison, part of the rabbinical hierarchy at Congregation Emanu-El, the city’s most prominent Reform Jewish synagogue, for 23 years. In the early-morning hours of February 20, police arrested him in his Upper West Side home. On April 17, a preliminary hearing will determine whether there is enough evidence for the case to go to trial. He is contesting the charges. “Howard Nevison is innocent, and we are confident he will be exonerated,” says his attorney, Ralph Jacobs.

k9zbbe,gfe6ju2,DJHJR86,"The Innocence Project regularly works in conjunction with The National Registry of Exonerations as a template for examining misconduct.  I 100% know that misconduct has happened (both deliberately and not) and continues to happen to this day.  But when they use cases like that of [Jay C. Smith](https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/casedetail.aspx?caseid=3645), I like to use the ""it's better that 1 guilty man go free than to convict 100 innocent men"" line of logic...if the National Registry of Exonerations has actual guilty people on their list as ""exonerated"", well everything about that list should be questioned.  Smith was exonerated due to hearsay being admitted at his trial, and alleged exculpatory evidence being suppressed by the prosecution.  Smith was released and sought compensation and a civil jury ruled **unanimously against** him.  That decision was upheld.  Why would they do that for a clearly ""innocent"" man who had been exonerated?!

> Smith's instant civil rights suit arises from the testimony of Corporal John Balshy, a Pennsylvania State Trooper who testified for the Commonwealth. Corporal Balshy was one of the investigators assigned to the Reinert investigation, and **he had been present during Reinert's autopsy. He testified that before the autopsy began, he examined Reinert's body for physical evidence, and found the red fibers that were subsequently linked to the carpet in Smith's home. He also testified that he noticed what he termed a ""sparkle"" on the feet of Susan Reinert, and that he used rubber ""lifters"" to collect the material from her feet.** He used a total of five lifters to collect material. He testified that two lifters each contained one grain of this ""sparkle"" material, and that the material was lifted from Reinert's left foot and left heel. **Balshy said that he thought that the material lifted from Reinert's feet was dust or lint that was of no evidentiary value, but he conceded that it ""could have been sand.""** Balshy gave the lifters to State Trooper Ronald F. Coyler, who was collecting evidence during the investigation. **The existence of sand on Ms. Reinert's feet supported Smith's theory that Reinert was killed at the seashore. However, the Commonwealth did not disclose the existence of the lifters to Smith or his trial counsel and they were never introduced into evidence.**

> The lifters containing two grains of quartz crystals that could have been beach sand were favorable to Smith. They were exculpatory to the extent that they corroborated his contention that Bradfield killed Reinert at the Cape May shore. Thus, the Commonwealth had an affirmative duty to disclose them to Smith, and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court so held. We share that Court's condemnation of the prosecutorial misconduct that occurred here. The reprehensible and unethical conduct of some of those involved in that prosecution is not, however, relevant to our inquiry in determining if Smith has made out his cause of action under§ 1983. **Despite the prosecutorial misconduct, Smith must establish the prejudice required for the due process violation that is the sine qua non of his claim for relief. He has not done so.**

> **Balshy testified at the civil trial as he had at Smith's criminal trial. He told the jury about noticing the sparkle on Reinert's feet and using the lifters to collect them. Although he testified at Smith's criminal trial that the material could have been sand, he testified at the trial in the instant suit that he was not qualified to make a scientific determination as to the exact nature of the material. Other witnesses testified that the material was quartz and that it was ""ubiquitous"" on the earth's surface.**

> The quartz was examined by two forensic geologists. One was Christopher Fiedler of the FBI laboratory in Washington, D.C. He concluded that the quartz was ""common sand,"" probably originating from opal or amethyst. Mr. Fiedler testified that quartz is found over most of the earth's dry surface, perhaps as much as 65% of the earth's crust. He termed the material he found ""ubiquitous,"" and opined that he would find at least two crystals on the body or in the clothing of any person in the courtroom at the time he testified.

> In a supplemental footnote, the court noted: ""a search of internet sources"" discovered one reference that concluded: ""Quartz is the most abundant mineral in the Earth's crust. Quartz has been found in meteorites and in some rocks collected on the moon."" **The court then summarized its assessment of the impact that withholding such evidence had on the integrity of Smith's murder convictions as follows: ""It appears then that having these crystals on one's feet is as indicative of a trip to the moon as a trip to the beach."" Although the court was clearly engaging in hyperbole, we nevertheless share its conclusion that the post-conviction disclosure of the lifters, and the particles on them, falls woefully short of undermining confidence in Smith's murder convictions.**

> **Even if we ignore the hearsay statements that were improperly admitted against Smith, and even if we also ignore Martray's suspect testimony, our confidence in Smith's convictions is not diminished in the least. We remain firmly convinced of the integrity of those guilty verdicts. Accordingly, there was no due process violation for purposes of Smith's § 1983 claim. A Brady violation is established ""by showing that the favorable evidence could reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a diifferent light as to undermine confidence in the verdict."" The two grains of quartz can not possibly offset the evidence of Smith's guilt that was presented to the jury that convicted him of murdering Susan Reinert and her two children. Smith has not come close to demonstrating ""a reasonable probability that the [criminal] jury would have returned a different verdict if the information had been disclosed. Accordingly, he has not established that withholding Brady material resulted in a Brady violation, and we can therefore dispose of Smith's remaining issues with only brief discussion.**

Rape is hard to prosecute and most rapists walk free because the system is broken. You're naive if you think all rapists get convicted, even with hard evidence.

> Stacey was strangled and sodomized. Reed has a history of violence and rape (victims testified at his trial and his DNA was a match to three other open rape cases with similar MOs). That history included strangling his victims with belts or articles of clothing and sodomizing them, including a 12 year old girl, who had Reed’s DNA inside her vagina. 

>  What is it now..two other relative of hers have verified his claim

After 20 years of silence, they only come out now saying that Stacy had an affair with Reed? Weak 'evidence'.

Reed only claimed to have an affair with Stacy after he found out his DNA was on her body.

> When Reed was first questioned, he denied knowing her. Over and over again. It was only after he was presented with the DNA evidence that he changes his story and claimed a secret sexual relationship. The only other time he claimed this was in a separate rape case 10 years prior - used the same excise as his defense. However, he consistently dated white women, openly. Never in secret. Never hidden. The mother of his children is white. The only time he claimed secret relationships because of racial tensions was when he was accused of rape. Twice. 

You're grasping at straws trying to prove Reed's innocence. He's a rapist and murderer and deserves to rot in prison for the rest of his life.

This is hardly a confirmation, as Horton vaguely claims that he saw Reed in the paper ""sometime after Stacey's death"", and recognized him as the guy she was with at the Dairy Queen. His own cousin was murdered and he had seen her with an unknown black male a couple of months before her murder, but he failed to pass on this potentially important piece of information to the investigators.

ht2mnk,fyevjmk,AnonAmost,"Your post is intentionally misleading, irresponsible and dangerous. You're not even sticking to the actual issue at hand while peddling  your own narrative: 

>Regardless he belongs in jail.

Um, he's not in jail, he's on **death row**, and he's been there for more than 22 years.  The case for which he awaits execution is separate from the **allegations** of rape that you're highlighting to push your narrative.  

>Reed did not go to trial for these other attacks because he was already on trial for the capital murder of Stacey.

That is patently untrue.  These allegations were *never* brought to charge.  They were used by prosecutors during during the **sentencing phase in the Stites trial** for the **sole** **purpose** of bolstering the chances that Reed would get the death penalty, but he was never formally charged with these crimes.  

Yet, here you are,  asserting that the state had **DNA evidence** proving he raped an *intellectually disabled* woman and a *12yo child* and just decided to let it those go because he got the death penalty in an unrelated case? Keep in mind that a defendant sentenced to death is entitled to an automatic appeal in Texas. So how does that make any sense? How are *those* victims receiving justice?

The issue at hand - the one in the article you linked but didn't really talk about - ultimately isn't even about guilt or innocence.  It's about due process, constitutional protections, and whether or not the person sitting on death row got a fair trial in the first place.  

It's irresponsible for you to come here an assert allegations as ""facts"" to justify you being comfortable with the fact that he's rotting on death row.  ""Well, I'm sure he's guilty of *something*"" isn't fucking good enough.

1. Austin native Linda Schlueter was visiting friends in Bastrop when she stopped to use a drive-up payphone . She identified Reed out of a lineup as the man who attacked her who forcibly attempted to rape her.
2. Reed said he never knew the victim then changed his story after DNA evidence linked him to the rape/murder
3. Reed's DNA matched two other rape cases. One of them is a mentally challenged 12 year old girl who gave a general description of Reed. Reed's DNA evidence was a match.
4. Vivian Harbottle was raped. Reported it immediately and DNA was found to match Reed.
5. Testing showed Rodney Reed’s DNA in Stacey Stites’ underwear, which is why prosecutors argued she had been raped shortly before her death.  It also found Rodney Reed’s DNA on her pants, on her back brace , on her breasts, in her vagina and in her rectum.  The medical examiner found that Stacey Stites’ cause of death was asphyxia due to ligature strangulation during a sexual assault. The medical examiner found Stacey Stites’ anus was dilated and had peri-mortem injuries – an injury that happens at or around the time of death.
6. He has been linked to no less than 5 rapes or attempted rapes. The 5th occurred in 1987. IN which he also claimed to be having a clandestine affair. He admitted to hitting her and giving her a swollen eye.

The state absolutely has  Reed on a DNA match for 2 rapes, excluding the rape of Stites.

ht2mnk,fzppet6,ssp92,"The case that Reed killed Stacey Stites is very strong though. Aside from the DNA found in multiple places on Stacey's body and one item in the truck, as well as no credible proof of the the affair, there's allot of circumstantial evidence that points towards Reed.

a) Reed lied about not knowing Stacey initially. Then came up with the secret affair defense at trial, only after being presented with the DNA evidence. \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587\_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf)  \- page 207a\] The argument that he was afraid of admitting to the interracial relationship in small-town racist Bastrop, holds no water, seeing as in 1996, Reed already had two children with Lucy Eipper, also a white woman. \[[https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808\_88cb22cd079e4d3f8c9c6e9c5dccf1ae.pdf](https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808_88cb22cd079e4d3f8c9c6e9c5dccf1ae.pdf) \- page 20\]

b) Tests of Jimmy Fennell’s truck, where the prosecution theorizes part of the attack took place, found that a person around 6 feet, 2 was the last driver of the vehicle based on the height of the seat in relation to the mirrors. Reed is 6 feet, 2. \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587\_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf) \- page 4a-5a, 26a, [https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808\_ff1ce06e53b44745b718717fae875c2b.pdf](https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808_ff1ce06e53b44745b718717fae875c2b.pdf) \- page 43\]

c) Jimmy Fennell’s Truck was found in the Bastrop High School parking lot, about sixth-tenths of a mile, approximately a 15-minute walk, from Reed’s residence at the time of the murder. \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587\_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf) \- page 116a, 207a\]

d) Police often saw Reed on the route Stites would drive for work, in the early hours of the morning. One officer testified that it would be a regular occurrence for him to see Reed in 1995-1997, between 9:00pm and 3:00am in the area. \[[https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/50\_reporters-record\_jury-trial-guilt-innocence-afternoon-session\_volume-50-of-69.pdf](https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/50_reporters-record_jury-trial-guilt-innocence-afternoon-session_volume-50-of-69.pdf) \- page 70\]

e) Unbeknownst to the Jury at trial, Reed became a suspect under very incriminating circumstances. About 6 months after the Stites murder; a woman named Linda Schluter went to police after a tall black man tried to sexually assault her and stole her car, at around 3am in Bastrop. \[[https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808\_26423e4169d34d57b5daba08aca49852.pdf](https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808_26423e4169d34d57b5daba08aca49852.pdf) \- page 44-47\] Based on her description of the perpetrator, as well the area the attack took place, where police had often seen Reed in those early hours, they zeroed in on Reed and Schlueter picked him out of a photo lineup. Because of the similarities with the Stites case police thought Reed a likely suspect: in addition to the attack taking place around the same time and area, Schlueter’s vehicle was also dumped in close proximity to Reed’s residence. \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/45899/20180507150103836\_Reed%20BIO%20FINAL.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/45899/20180507150103836_Reed%20BIO%20FINAL.pdf) \- page 5, 8\] It was at this time law enforcement thought to match the DNA found in the Stites murder with Reed. Reed did not become a suspect in the Stites case until late February, early march of 1997. \[[https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/46\_reporters-record\_jury-trial-guilt-innocence-phase-afternoon-session\_volume-46-of-69.pdf](https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/46_reporters-record_jury-trial-guilt-innocence-phase-afternoon-session_volume-46-of-69.pdf) \- page 122\]

f) After the trial, In the 2006 documentary “State vs Reed”, Reed  also lied about Stacey being drug user, stating: 

*“I remember, there was a time, where Stacey, she would come with marijuana and wanted me to trade it for cocaine, crack cocaine. “* \[[https://youtu.be/LLTcV664IgU?t=3049](https://youtu.be/LLTcV664IgU?t=3049) \- Timecode approx. 50:49-51:05\]

Hair sample analysis did not reveal Stacey to be a user of cocaine. Likewise was her H.E.B employment drug screening negative for any drugs. 

Emphasis mine: 

*“Regarding the allegation of Stacey's crack cocaine use with Reed, the trial judge found that the toxicology report from* ***Stacey's autopsy was negative for drugs and alcohol****.* ***The drug screen conducted by H.E.B.*** *before Stacey was hired* ***was also negative****. Further, the trial judge found: Prior to trial, the State sent samples of Stacey Stites' hair to National Medical Services, Inc. in Pennsylvania.* ***That laboratory analyzed 32 centimeters of her hair in order to determine whether cocaine or its metabolites were present****. As that laboratory's report indicates,* ***two different analyses were negative for cocaine.*** *Since hair grows at an approximate rate of one centimeter per month, the State was prepared, through the use of these analyses, to prove that* ***Stacey Stites was not a cocaine user for the last 32 months of her life****.”* \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587\_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf) \- page 179a\]",1,1596101914.0,False,https://reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/ht2mnk/new_date_set_for_rodney_reed_appeal_hearing_now/fzppet6/,t1_fyep4cb,2

hlong4,fxkrye7,None,"I really loved that series! My favourite in a long time - there's a lot of appeal in horror anthologies, partly because you really don't know how a given episode will end, besides that the framing device will usually be intact until the finale. And partly just nostalgia.

I do love seeing trans woman characters that are not villains, even/especially if they're a little bit dark. Poor representation is one of my biggest issues with horror, my favourite genre. As a trans woman, I found Fran a compelling character, and was not surprised at all the author was trans. Though I did really wish the other girl hadn't died - the story really wouldn't have lost anything if she had've ultimately survived, besides making it less sad. I'm very biased towards more upbeat twists. On my first read-through, I incorrectly assumed the daughter *was* Fran, and the ""corpse"" was discarded flesh from a makeover. A few lines indicate otherwise, and 

I attempted to respond with a couple of comments across the series itself expressing my love of the stories and asking for more, but kept tripping up on the nosleep rules, and I think only the last one ended up approved (with the mods' help - they're quite nice). Suffice to say, I find it very, *very*, difficult to express your fondness for a story if you are not allowed to say anything that implies it is fiction. I am used to SSS, which is much easier to comment on, especially if you're in the habit of thanking authors, and I'm also used to editing in general, so I've developed strong habits about talking about stories that really don't fit there.

I managed to find the  trial transcripts. Only 3 people claimed to know they were dating. Two people were his friends and one family member. I could only find 2 of the testimonies referenced in the closing arguments. Not only is it hearsay but one witness said her name was Stephanie and came by looking for him and didn’t know they were dating. The other claimed she saw them talking at the grocery store she worked at. That’s not evidence of an affair. I put zero stalk in the “new “ witness coming out of the wood work 20 years later. All of it is unsubstantiated hearsay. 

In fact in neither opening or closing statements , does his lawyers even attempt to explains how they met or even knew each other just that they had an affair, that no one can prove. They casually mention it then, insist the finance or a guy name David Lawhon did it. Lawhon was already convicted for a different murder and tried to say Stacy dated him at some point too, which they also couldn’t prove. 

Yes the fiancé is a piece of shit, but you can’t pin this on him.

g7h4ai,fpkcwgi,ssp92,"You know what pisses me off? Misinformation.

Reed’s DNA (not just semen) was in found in multiple places. At trial, the jury was made aware of intact spermatozoa DNA in the victim, as well as saliva DNA on her breasts – further confirmed by tests performed by the defense’s own expert, Dr. Johnson.

Emphasis mine:

*“Dr. Johnson's DQ–Alpha* ***testing on the saliva from breast swabs taken by Blakley yielded the same results as the previous testing conducted by DPS***\*. On the swab taken from Stacey's left breast, testing indicated 1.2, 4.1, and 3 alleles, and on the swab taken from Stacey right breast, testing indicated 1.2, 3, and 4.1 alleles.\* ***Dr. Johnson conceded that in all of the sixteen sites tested in this case, Reed could not be excluded as the donor of the semen and saliva found on Stacey's body.”*** \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587\_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf) \- page 122a\]

*“Dr. Johnson identified the substance as* ***saliva based on an amylase test***\*. Amylase is a primary component of saliva, according to Dr. Johnson. Dr. Johnson stated that\* ***it was likely that the saliva got there after Stacey's last shower***\*, which was the night before she was murdered\*.” \[[https://law.justia.com/cases/texas/court-of-criminal-appeals/2008/17748.html](https://law.justia.com/cases/texas/court-of-criminal-appeals/2008/17748.html)\]

New testing done in 2014 also showed Reed’s DNA from touch mixed with the victim’s on her back-brace found in the truck, as well as her pants. \[[https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808\_99b68a76d3144c4faac8375a404f376d.pdf](https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808_99b68a76d3144c4faac8375a404f376d.pdf) \- page 11\]

Emphasis mine:

*“Reed also could not be excluded, using Y-STR analysis, from three* ***vaginal swabs, a rectal swab, Stites’s panties, vaginalswab sticks, a vaginal sperm-search slide***\*, and\* ***extracts of stains found on Stites’s back brace, pants, and a breast swab***\*. Suppl.CR(DNA).53. This additional testing demonstrated that\* ***DNA profiles consistent with Reed’s were in even more locations than what the jury knew about—Stites’s back brace (found in the truck) and her pants (she was wearing).”***

\[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/45899/20180507150103836\_Reed%20BIO%20FINAL.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/45899/20180507150103836_Reed%20BIO%20FINAL.pdf) \- page 13\]

This argument also blatantly ignores the ample amount of circumstantial evidence against Reed:

a) Reed lied about not knowing Stacey Stites initially. Then came up with the secret affair defense at trial, only after being presented with the DNA evidence. \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587\_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf)  \- page 207a\] The argument that he was afraid of admitting to the interracial relationship in small-town racist Bastrop, holds no water, seeing as in 1996, Reed already had two children with Lucy Eipper, a white woman. \[[https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808\_88cb22cd079e4d3f8c9c6e9c5dccf1ae.pdf](https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808_88cb22cd079e4d3f8c9c6e9c5dccf1ae.pdf) \- page 20\]

b) Tests of Jimmy Fennell’s truck, where the prosecution theorizes part of the attack took place, found that a person around 6 feet, 2 was the last driver of the vehicle based on the height of the seat in relation to the mirrors. Reed is 6 feet, 2. \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587\_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf) \- page 4a-5a, 26a, [https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808\_ff1ce06e53b44745b718717fae875c2b.pdf](https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808_ff1ce06e53b44745b718717fae875c2b.pdf) \- page 43\]

c) Jimmy Fennell’s Truck was found in the Bastrop High School parking lot, about sixth-tenths of a mile, approximately a 15-minute walk, from Reed’s residence. \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587\_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf) \- page 116a, 207a\]

d) Police often saw Reed on the route Stites would drive for work, in the early hours of the morning. One officer testified that it would be a regular occurrence for him to see Reed in 1995-1997, between 9:00pm and 3:00am in the area. \[[https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/50\_reporters-record\_jury-trial-guilt-innocence-afternoon-session\_volume-50-of-69.pdf](https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/50_reporters-record_jury-trial-guilt-innocence-afternoon-session_volume-50-of-69.pdf) \- page 70\]

e) Unbeknownst to the Jury at trial, Reed became a suspect under very incriminating circumstances. About 6 months after the Stites murder; a woman named Linda Schlueter went to police after a tall black man tried to sexually assault her and stole her car, at around 3am in Bastrop. \[[https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808\_26423e4169d34d57b5daba08aca49852.pdf](https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808_26423e4169d34d57b5daba08aca49852.pdf) \- page 44-47\] Based on her description of the perpetrator, as well the area the attack took place, where police had often seen Reed in those early hours, they zeroed in on Reed and Schlueter picked him out of a photo lineup. Because of the similarities with the Stites case police thought Reed a likely suspect: in addition to the attack taking place around the same time and area, Schlueter’s vehicle was also dumped in close proximity to Reed’s residence. \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/45899/20180507150103836\_Reed%20BIO%20FINAL.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/45899/20180507150103836_Reed%20BIO%20FINAL.pdf) \- page 5, 8\] Because of the similarities between the cases; it was at this time law enforcement thought to match the DNA found in the Stites murder with Reed. Reed did not become a suspect in the Stites case until late February, early march of 1997. \[[https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/46\_reporters-record\_jury-trial-guilt-innocence-phase-afternoon-session\_volume-46-of-69.pdf](https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/46_reporters-record_jury-trial-guilt-innocence-phase-afternoon-session_volume-46-of-69.pdf) \- page 122\]

&#x200B;

With the substantial amount of evidence, both forensic and circumstantial, against Reed, it’s simply untrue to say that the only evidence is the sperm DNA, alluding to the defense’s theory that Reed and the victim, were in a month long clandestine relationship, which has never been proven, and the witnesses claiming otherwise were found not to be credible or Reed's counsel failed to have them testify at the hearing in 2017, making their statements as of this writing: hearsay.

While is prison, he confessed to one of the inmates that he did indeed murder Stacey stities. Also, while looking over her body after he being found, he had said ""she got what she deserved"". A salesperson also over heard him tell Stacey that if she ever cheated he would kill her and nobody would know it was him. Stacey Stites family had said that Stacey brought Rodney home.

g7h4ai,fpkpxtx,ssp92,"For the record I just wanna say that Fennell is a piece of shit for what he did. He deserved every one of these 10 years he served, and I hope he burns in hell. That being said, he had nothing to do with the murder of his fiancé.

The cellmate, Snow said Fennell confessed to him in 2008, \[[https://www.innocenceproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Signed-Affidavit-of-Arthur-Snow\_Redacted\_Higher-Res.pdf](https://www.innocenceproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Signed-Affidavit-of-Arthur-Snow_Redacted_Higher-Res.pdf)\], Yet he didn’t come forward until October 21th, 2019 – Only one month before Reed’s execution date, and a time where the media frenzy about the case was at an all-time high, due to the approaching execution date. Snow now of all times, remembers this confession that happened almost 9 years earlier. Snow also gives a motive for him lying about this confession right in his affidavit, as he states that Fennell had him sent to a more secure unit, with false testimony. \[part 9\] Snow is currently in still incarcerated for forgery, which gives him yet another motive for lying: providing information about a murder is great way to get a reduced sentence or other privileges. Here’s what the innocence project has to say about the usage of jailhouse informant testimony, and the benefits the informants get for lying: \[[https://www.innocenceproject.org/informing-injustice/](https://www.innocenceproject.org/informing-injustice/) & [https://www.innocenceproject.org/jailhouse-informant-nytimes-paul-skalnik/](https://www.innocenceproject.org/jailhouse-informant-nytimes-paul-skalnik/)\] This is the kind of testimony the innocence project is usually vehemently against, but are willing make a compromise on in this particular case, when it benefits their client.

The insurance salesperson's testimony is off to a shoddy start.  \[[https://www.innocenceproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Rodney-Reed-Request-for-Commutation.pdf](https://www.innocenceproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Rodney-Reed-Request-for-Commutation.pdf) \- page 50.\] They also waited to come forward with this crucial information for 20 years. Furthermore, If you were gonna kill your girlfriend for the insurance money, the absolute stupidest thing you could ever do would be to loudly proclaim this in front of the insurance saleperson. The whole ""and nobody will ever find out""-part comes off as almost comical, as he is supposedly saying this loud enough for the salesperson to hear.  Do you really buy this? I don't, and I doubt the courts will either, should this witness ever get cross-examined.

Same goes for Jim Clampit, the officer who supposedly heard Fennell say ""She got what she deserved"" at Stacey's funeral. \[[https://www.innocenceproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Rodney-Reed-Request-for-Commutation.pdf](https://www.innocenceproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Rodney-Reed-Request-for-Commutation.pdf) \- page 50\] He is a police officer, he heard this incredibly incriminating uttering, yet failed to report it for 20 years, despite it being his sworn duty. His credibility is put in question as a result of this.   Furthermore it is hard hard to buy, that the man who would allegedly kill his fiancé and make look like a perfect rape and murder at the hands of Rodney Reed, down to the height of the truckseat matching Reed's height, \[[https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808\_ff1ce06e53b44745b718717fae875c2b.pdf](https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808_ff1ce06e53b44745b718717fae875c2b.pdf) \- page 43\] would so carelessly exclaim that she got what she deserved at her public funeral loud enough for people, not to mention the multiple police officers attending, to hear.

g7h4ai,fpkq7ft,ssp92,"Between the murder in April, 1996, and Reed’s arrest in May 1997, not one single person came forward to point out this alleged secret relationship; this is in spite of a $50.000 reward being offered by Stacey’s place of work, H.E.B. Everyone remotely connected to Stacey were also interviewed by the police.

Emphasis mine:

*“Over the course of the next eleven months,* ***authorities focused their investigation on people that Stacey knew,*** *and with a* ***$50,000 reward offered by H.E.B.****, numerous leads and information poured in. For instance, a newspaper-delivery person reported that Stacey's body was not on Bluebonnet Drive when he drove by the site where her body was found at 4:00 a.m. In all,* ***officials interviewed hundreds of people, including former classmates, boyfriends, and coworkers, as well*** *as* ***Stacey's friends and coworkers at H.E.B.*** *“*

Then, after Reed became a suspect, through a DNA match, witnesses starting coming forward. Friends of Reed and the family said they knew of the relationship and wanted to take the stand. Not one of Stacey’ family members, friends or coworkers came forward with knowledge about the affair at trial in 1998.

One of the trial witnesses for the defense, Iris Lindley, a friend of the Reed family, testified that a white woman named Stephanie came to the Reed residence asking for Rodney. Only when prompted by the defense attorney did Lindley admit it could have been Stephanie or Stacey. \[[https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/53\_reporters-record\_jury-trial-guilt-innocence-morning-session\_volume-53-of-69-1.pdf](https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/53_reporters-record_jury-trial-guilt-innocence-morning-session_volume-53-of-69-1.pdf) \- page 92\] Her getting the name wrong was a big reason why the jury didn’t believe Lindley at trial, but she also got the truck, Stacey was supposedly driving, wrong as Lindley described it as a gray truck. \[[https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/53\_reporters-record\_jury-trial-guilt-innocence-morning-session\_volume-53-of-69-1.pdf](https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/53_reporters-record_jury-trial-guilt-innocence-morning-session_volume-53-of-69-1.pdf) \- page 96\] Stacey’s mother, Carol Stites testified, she has never known her daughter to drive a truck like that. \[[https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/55\_reporters-record\_jury-trial-guilty-innocence-morning-session\_volume-55-of-69.pdf](https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/55_reporters-record_jury-trial-guilty-innocence-morning-session_volume-55-of-69.pdf) \- page 17-18\]

Likewise were the other witnesses at trial found not to be credible;

“Without reliable evidence demonstrating how this happened consensually, the DNA evidence effectively condemns Reed. And what evidence is there of a prior relationship? Statements of people who claim to have seen the two together. Yet, many of these are the very sort of eyewitness accounts that have been shown in numerous cases to be unreliable. Most of these witnesses did not know Stacey Stites, and identified her from memory by viewing her photograph. Those who claimed to have known her were proven to be badly mistaken. All of these witnesses were family, friends, or associates of Reed’s. Reed was never able to identify anyone who was a friend, family member, or associate of Stacey Stites who claimed to have been aware of a relationship between Reed and Stites. In short, there is no reliable evidence that ties Reed to Stites before her murder.”

\[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587\_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf) \- page 81a\]

But let’s address the new witnesses, not heard at trial in 1998, whose affidavits you can read here: \[[https://www.innocenceproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Rodney-Reed-Request-for-Commutation.pdf](https://www.innocenceproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Rodney-Reed-Request-for-Commutation.pdf) \- page 32-34\] The biggest one, Alicia Slater, who was a coworker of Stacey at the time of the murder, stated this in her affidavit: “On one occasion when Stacey and were eating together in-the break room, she talked to me about her relationship with her fiancé. She was talking about her engagement ring and that she was not excited about getting married. She told me that she was sleeping with black guy named Rodney and that she didn’t know what her fiancé would do if he found out. “\[[https://www.innocenceproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Reed-Rodney\_Exhibits-Reduced-.pdf](https://www.innocenceproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Reed-Rodney_Exhibits-Reduced-.pdf) – Exhibit 28, page 2\] Slater waited until November 2014 to come forward with this information, despite the police interviewing her about Stites before Reed became a suspect. \[[https://www.innocenceproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Reed-Rodney\_Exhibits-Reduced-.pdf](https://www.innocenceproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Reed-Rodney_Exhibits-Reduced-.pdf) – Exhibit 28, page 1\] Nor is there any compelling reason as to why Stites would confide in her over any of her closer friends or family. Her affidavit is also put into question by the victim’s mother, Carol Stites’ trial testimony. Carol Stites testified that Stacey would always come home around 1:30 pm. If we factor in travel time from Giddings to Bastrop, this means Stacey’s shift was from about 3:30am to 1pm. \[[https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/44\_reporters-record\_jury-trial-guilt-innocence-phase\_volume-44-of-69-1.pdf](https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/44_reporters-record_jury-trial-guilt-innocence-phase_volume-44-of-69-1.pdf) \- page 57-58\] It is highly unlikely for Stacey to have had the same lunch schedule as a part time employee and high school student like Slater, \[[https://www.innocenceproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Reed-Rodney\_Exhibits-Reduced-.pdf](https://www.innocenceproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Reed-Rodney_Exhibits-Reduced-.pdf) – Exhibit 28, page 1\]

Furthermore Carol Stites testified that Stacey never wore her wedding ring to work, since she was afraid it might get messy. \[[https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/44\_reporters-record\_jury-trial-guilt-innocence-phase\_volume-44-of-69-1.pdf](https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/44_reporters-record_jury-trial-guilt-innocence-phase_volume-44-of-69-1.pdf) \- page 81 and 91\]

Lastly Carol Stites testified that her daughter gave her the distinct impression that Stacey was very much looking forward to the upcoming wedding with Jimmy Fennell, that she loved him, and the last time Carol saw Stacey alive, the couple seemed happy and in love. \[[https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/44\_reporters-record\_jury-trial-guilt-innocence-phase\_volume-44-of-69-1.pdf](https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/44_reporters-record_jury-trial-guilt-innocence-phase_volume-44-of-69-1.pdf) \- page 64-66\] This is further backed up by the fact that Stacey had taken on the early morning shift in the produce section of H.E.B, to make an extra 50 cent per hour, in order to pay for the upcoming wedding. Carol Stites also stated that they were doing preparations for the wedding during most of Stacey’s free time. \[[https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/44\_reporters-record\_jury-trial-guilt-innocence-phase\_volume-44-of-69-1.pdf](https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/44_reporters-record_jury-trial-guilt-innocence-phase_volume-44-of-69-1.pdf) \- page 52-54\]

Ask yourself, despite Alicia Slater’s testimony; being exactly what the defense needed, going so far as to even mentioning the defendant by name, why did the defense not to put her (or the other witnesses of the alleged relationship, for that matter) on the stand at the evidentiary hearing in October, 2017?",1,1588699129.0,False,https://reddit.com/r/political/comments/g7h4ai/rodney_reed/fpkq7ft/,t1_fpkpxtx,3

g7h4ai,fpkq8j9,ssp92,"  

The other new witnesses have also failed to give compelling reasons for sitting on this important information for so long, thus putting their credibility into question. Including Stacey’s cousin Calvin “Buddy” Horton. His own cousin was murdered and he had seen her with an unknown black male a couple of months before her murder, but he failed to pass on this potentially important piece of information to the investigators. 

Likewise, a coworker named Lee Roy Ybarra, said that he didn’t come forward because the police hadn’t contacted him, notwithstanding that he had plenty of incentive to come forward. The police interviewed every one of Stacey’s coworkers in 1996 and there was a reward of $50.000 offered by his own place of work, which he also failed to claim by not giving up this information in 1996. \[[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587\_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/34075/20180201153354587_Rodney%20Reed%20--%20Appendix.pdf) \- page 112a\]

   
 

I think it's pretty clear that the evidence points towards Reed and not Fennell. It's DNA evidence and credible, cross examined witnesses vs incredible witnesses or witnesses who have not bean cross examined and failed polygraph tests.

>""Fennell was quickly taken off that list of suspects and bang.. as you know it Rodney Reed was the new suspect."" 

Reed did not become a suspect until late February early march of 1997; 10-11 months after the murder.  [https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/46\_reporters-record\_jury-trial-guilt-innocence-phase-afternoon-session\_volume-46-of-69.pdf](https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/46_reporters-record_jury-trial-guilt-innocence-phase-afternoon-session_volume-46-of-69.pdf) \- page 122. Hardly a ""quickly"" transition of main suspects, as you seem to be alluding to. You also failed to mention the incriminating circumstances that led police to Reed.   About 6 months after the Stites murder; a woman named Linda Schluter went to police after a tall black man tried to sexually assault her and stole her car, at around 3am in Bastrop. [https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808\_26423e4169d34d57b5daba08aca49852.pdf](https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808_26423e4169d34d57b5daba08aca49852.pdf) page 44-47. Based on her description of the perpetrator, as well the area the attack took place, where police had often seen Reed, they zeroed in on Reed and Schluter picked him out of a photo lineup. Because of the similarities with the Stites case, police thought Reed a likely suspect: in addition to the attack taking place around the same time and area, Schluter’s vehicle was also dumped in close proximity to Reed’s residence, same as Stites'. [https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/45899/20180507150103836\_Reed%20BIO%20FINAL.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1093/45899/20180507150103836_Reed%20BIO%20FINAL.pdf) page 5, 8. 

Those are some pretty important details to just leave out, and the I'm only 3 minutes in. 

Then you start listing off the witnesses, some of which were already addressed and dismissed at the trial in 1998, (Iris Lindley, who got Stacey's name wrong, and wrongly described the vehicle she was driving  [https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/53\_reporters-record\_jury-trial-guilt-innocence-morning-session\_volume-53-of-69-1.pdf](https://rodneyreedfulltruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/53_reporters-record_jury-trial-guilt-innocence-morning-session_volume-53-of-69-1.pdf) page 92 ) or the early hearings (Mary Blackwell, who could not be corroborated by one of 29 other cops at the seminar  [https://law.justia.com/cases/texas/court-of-criminal-appeals/2008/17748.html](https://law.justia.com/cases/texas/court-of-criminal-appeals/2008/17748.html)  search; ""Blackwell"") , or witnesses that Reed's council had the option of having testify at the hearing in 2017, but somehow didn't, (Including Alicia Slater- who was a part time employee and high school student at the time of the murder - thus unlikely to have lunch with Stites who worked the graveyard shift from 3:30 am) Probably because Reed's council knew their testimony would fall apart on cross examination. All the while you're  making it sound like these witnesses have never been heard or that they're' somehow credible. 

At about 4 minutes in, you start talking about how Fennel confessed to an incarcerated Aryan brotherhood member. For context, this convict, Arthur Snow didn’t come forward until October 21th, 2019 – Only one month before Reed’s execution date, and a time where the media frenzy about the case was at an all-time high, due to the approaching execution date. Snow now of all times, remembers this confession that happened almost 9 years earlier, in 2008. Snow also gives a motive for him lying about this confession right in his affidavit, as he states that Fennell had him sent to a more secure unit, with false testimony.  [https://www.innocenceproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Signed-Affidavit-of-Arthur-Snow\_Redacted\_Higher-Res.pdf](https://www.innocenceproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Signed-Affidavit-of-Arthur-Snow_Redacted_Higher-Res.pdf) part 9. Snow is currently in still incarcerated for forgery, which gives him yet another motive for lying: providing information about a murder is great way to get a reduced sentence or other privileges. Here’s what the innocence project  has to say about the usage of jailhouse informant testimony, and the benefits the informants get for lying: [https://www.innocenceproject.org/informing-injustice/](https://www.innocenceproject.org/informing-injustice/) & [https://www.innocenceproject.org/jailhouse-informant-nytimes-paul-skalnik/](https://www.innocenceproject.org/jailhouse-informant-nytimes-paul-skalnik/). If the innocence project says we should not trust prison informants, why should we trust Snow's word on this? 

I don't know if Reed's family only agreed to talk you if you agreed to say that Reed is innocent,  or if you legitimately believe him to be a good candidate for wrongful conviction. I Maybe be able excuse you since, as you also stated in those first 2 minutes, that at the time, Reed was only 6 days away from execution, and you may not have the time to make an unbiased portrayal if your agenda was to get a stay for Reed or Anti death penalty.

It of course doesn't mean that Snow is lying, but it'd not looking credible on the outset, and it's highly likely to fall apart on cross examination should Reed's council put Snow on the stand in September. 

Are you referring to what Jim Clampit heard Fennell said at Stacey's funeral as a confession? That Stacey ""got what she deserved""? ttps://www.innocenceproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Rodney-Reed-Request-for-Commutation.pdf - page 50.
While on the face of it a much more credible source than Snow, Clapit loses credibly by his failure to report said Fennell's incriminating remark in 1996.  Being an officer it's highly problematic he did not disclose this information so long ago. Furthermore I find it hard to buy, that the man who would allegedly kill his fiance and make look like a perfect rape and murder by the hands of Rodney Reed, down to the height of the seat matching Reed's height, (https://70659d40-1bda-4ecf-9620-35ee056757e2.filesusr.com/ugd/235808_ff1ce06e53b44745b718717fae875c2b.pdf - page 43) would so carelessly exclaim that she got what she deserved at her public funeral loud enough for people to hear, like he was some supervillain monologuing to himself. 

As for a 3rd confession, I don't know what you could be referring to, but it could be the anonymous insurance salesperson. https://www.innocenceproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Rodney-Reed-Request-for-Commutation.pdf - page 50. 
They claim Jimmy Fennell threatened to kill his fiance while taking out a life insurance on her, which is probably the absolute stupidest thing you could ever do, if you were planning to kill someone and get the insurance money. It could be true, but we'll but have to wait until September to find out if the story hold up. 

If I'm wrong, I would like to know which alleged three confessions you were referring to, if not the above.

When York did not listen, she was repeatedly struck, dragged to her bedroom, and raped multiple times. 57.RR.37–42.

When confronted with a search warrant for biological samples, Reed had an about-face, “Yeah, I had sex with her, she wanted it.” 57.RR.138. The case went to trial four years later, 57.RR.30, 60, and Reed was acquitted, 57.RR.61.

A.W. awoke when someone began pushing her face into the couch and had blindfolded and gagged her. 58.RR.42–43. She was repeatedly hit in the head, called vulgar names, and orally, vaginally, and anally raped. 58.RR.43–49.

Eipper had two children with Reed. 59.RR.13–14, 19–20 Throughout their relationship, Reed physically abused Eipper, including while she was pregnant, and raped her “all the time,” including one time in front of their two children. 59.RR.14–17, 21, 25–32.Afterwards, Reed began dating Caroline Rivas, an intellectually disabled woman. 60.RR.39–41. Rivas’s caseworker noticed bruises on Rivas’s body and, when asked about them, Rivas admitted that Reed would hurt her if she would not have sex with him. 60.RR.41, 61.Later, Rivas’s caseworker noticed that Rivas was walking oddly and sat down gingerly. 60.RR.43. Rivas admitted that Reed had, the prior evening, hit her, called her vulgar names, and anally raped her. 60.RR.44, 63–65. The samples from Rivas’s rape kit provided the link to Stites’s murder. 60.RR.89–90.Shortly thereafter, and about six months before Stites’s murder, Reed raped Vivian Harbottle underneath a train trestle as she was walking home. 59.RR.87–92. When she pleaded for her life for the sake of her children, Reed laughed at her. 59.RR.94.

e826ji,falyydj,MrHistor,"I'm just going to leave this here...

>The rape and murder of Stites was hardly Reed’s first or last foray against women. First was Connie York, a nineteen-year-old who had come home late one evening after swimming with friends. 57.RR.34–35. York was grabbed from behind and told “don’t scream or I’ll hurt you.” 57.RR.35–36. When York did not listen, she was repeatedly struck, dragged to her bedroom, and raped multiple times. 57.RR.37–42. 
>
>Reed was interviewed, and, while he admitted that he knew York from high school, he denied raping her. 57.RR.123–24. When confronted with a search warrant for biological samples, Reed had an about-face, “Yeah, I had sex with her, she wanted it.” 57.RR.138. The case went to trial four years later, 57.RR.30, 60, and Reed was acquitted, 57.RR.61.  
>
>Next was A.W., a twelve-year-old girl, who was home alone, having fallen asleep on a couch after watching TV. 58.RR.36–42. A.W. awoke when someone began pushing her face into the couch and had blindfolded and gagged her. 58.RR.42–43. She was repeatedly hit in the head, called vulgar names, and orally, vaginally, and anally raped. 58.RR.43–49. The foreign DNA from A.W.’s rape kit was compared to Reed; Reed was not excluded and only one in 5.5 billion people would have the same foreign DNA profile from A.W.’s rape kit. 58.RR.51, 92;61.RR.26.  
>
>Then came Lucy Eipper, who Reed had met in high school, and whom Reed began to date after her graduation. 59.RR.10–12. Eipper had two children with Reed. 59.RR.13–14, 19–20 Throughout their relationship, Reed physically abused Eipper, including while she was pregnant, and raped her “all the time,” including one time in front of their two children. 59.RR.14–17, 21, 25–32.Afterwards, Reed began dating Caroline Rivas, an intellectually disabled woman. 60.RR.39–41. Rivas’s caseworker noticed bruises on Rivas’s body and, when asked about them, Rivas admitted that Reed would hurt her if she would not have sex with him. 60.RR.41, 61.Later, Rivas’s caseworker noticed that Rivas was walking oddly and sat down gingerly. 60.RR.43. Rivas admitted that Reed had, the prior evening, hit her, called her vulgar names, and anally raped her. 60.RR.44, 63–65. The samples from Rivas’s rape kit provided the link to Stites’s murder. 60.RR.89–90.Shortly thereafter, and about six months before Stites’s murder, Reed raped Vivian Harbottle underneath a train trestle as she was walking home. 59.RR.87–92. When she pleaded for her life for the sake of her children, Reed laughed at her. 59.RR.94. The foreign DNA from Harbottle’s rape kit Awas compared to Reed; he could not be excluded, and only one person in 5.5 billion would be expected to have the same foreign DNA profile. 59.RR.95, 113–14; 61.RR.26.  
>
>Finally, and about six months after Stites’s murder, Reed convinced nineteen-year-old Linda Schlueter to give him a ride home at about 3:30 a.m. 61.RR.10, 37–47. Reed led her to a remote area and then attacked her. 61.RR.47–58. After a prolonged struggle, Schlueter asked Reed what he wanted and Reed responded, “I want a blow job.” 61.RR.60. When Schlueter told Reed that “you will have to kill me before you get anything,” Reed stated “I guess I’ll have to kill you then.” 61.RR.60. Before Schlueter could be raped, a car drove by and Reed fled. 61.RR.62–64.

e2ebtg,f9k9iw2,radium__girl,"Thank you very much for this and all the work you put in it, it is very useful for me and I'm sure for many others.

I espacially like the one case per podcast stories and here is my contribution to your list with some podcasts I don't see to much on this sub. I don't know if your goal is to do an exhaustive list but I hope some of the podcasts below can help you. Be aware that I didn't listen to all of these podcasts but they are all in my wishlist.

Sorry if there is any double mention.

HANGING : a sheriff's deputy. His 10-year-old son. A bitter custody battle. A haunting death. Was it suicide? Or something more sinister? Twenty-five years later, authorities decided to take a closer look. So did Mercury News reporter Julia Prodis Sulek.


13 THE SEARCH FOR LEIGH OCCHI : return to the scene where thirteen year-old Leigh Occhi went missing, leaving behind only a bloodied nightgown.


THREE MEN AND A MYSTERY : the unsolved 1999 Alabama murders of J.B. Beasley & Tracie Hawlett.


5 ROSES : Newlywed bride Mary Shotwell Little vanished from Lenox Square in 1965. A year and a half later, Diane Shields was found brutally murdered in her own car’s trunk.  Atlanta would never be the same.


A MURDER ON ORCHARD STREET : An ex-NYC detective returns to the scene of an unsolved homicide, reuniting with the victim's sister and reaching out for help from the reporter who filmed the case moment-to-moment in 2003, in one last attempt to solve the crime and bring the murderers to justice.


AMBUSHED : Lorraine McNab and Peter Sopow are gunned down outside Lorraine’s home near Pincher Creek, Alberta. Their bodies are found 36 hours later. Lorraine's family speaks for the first time about what happened that day.


BLOOD AND TRUTH : Tommy Zeigler has been on death row for 42 years and for more than half that time, he’s been trying to convince the state of Florida to allow for DNA tests that might help exonerate him. But the state continually refuses. About 20 other men are in a similar situation, imprisoned in Florida since the 1970s or ’80s and arguing that it’s inherently unfair to deny them access to 21st century science.


BODY ON THE MOOR : Last December a man's body was discovered in the desolate landscape of Saddleworth Moor in the Peak District National Park.


BREAK IN THE CASE (NYPD Podcast) : A gruesome discovery by a road crew in Washington Heights sends the 34th Precinct Detective Squad on a hunt for a little girl's identity.


CASE CLOSED : two seasons


CHILLINGWORTH : Chillingworth recounts the lurid saga of the men behind the most notorious crime in Florida’s history: the grisly 1955 murder of a brilliant judge revered as an icon of integrity.


CHRISTINA GRIMMI, a Murder of a Rising Star : murder of Christina Grimmie in Orlando, FL shocked the world. The 22-year-old singer was gaining fans after coming in 3rd place on NBC's 'The Voice' competition show.


COVER-UP : A presidential hopeful crashes his car in the middle of the night and leaves a young woman to die. What transpired in the hours after Ted Kennedy’s car went over the bridge in Chappaquiddick changed the course of American history.


DEAD WRONG : Jeffrey Brooks feared for his life. He believed he was going to be murdered at his workplace - and that those involved would try and make it look like an accident. Not long after, Jeffrey was dead.


FROZEN LIES : What begins with a body in a kitchen freezer leads Debi Marshall to a sordid tale of seduction and lies, from Adelaide, to the Outback to the Adriatic Coast


DIRTY RATS : Dirty Rats is the true story of two of Boston's most powerful brothers - one a gangster, the other a politician - as they rose from poverty in a public-housing project to the pinnacles of power in their respective trades.


EMPIRE OF BLOOD : In the Bronx, in the early 90s, two young drug dealers ruled an intersection known as “The Corner on Blood.” They lived large, wearing mink, drinking champagne, getting rich. Then their fraught relationship fell apart, dead bodies piled up, and one accused the other of a double homicide he didn’t commit. Or did he?


END OF DAYS : The story of David Koresh: the prophet whose cult in Waco, Texas preached an apocalypse – and the 30 Britons taken in by his message.


FLATROCK : In Flatrock, host Olivia Lind explores the 1969 murder of 12-year-old Kathy Jones. Listeners will learn a side of the tragic story the public was never told.


GONE FISHING : Gail Maney was sent to prison on her son's birthday. The police said she'd put a hit on a man who stole drugs from her. She went to jail for 15 years.


KILLING LORENZEN : Lorenzen Wright's voice was last heard on a desperate 911 call in July of 2010, but his story — and the path that led him to that moment — began long before that fateful night.


MURDER AT LAND BETWEEN THE LAKES : On September 17th, 1980, two sisters, Carla Atkins & Vickie Stout, went missing from the small town of Dover, Tennessee. Their remains were found by two hikers 18 days later at Land Between The Lakes.

MY FATHER THE MURDERER: In order for me to be born, a stranger had to die. Now my quest to uncover the truth.


NOWHERE CHILD : William Tyrrell was a three year old boy who disappeared from the village of Kendall, on the mid-north-coast of New South Wales. Key facts were kept from the public, from day one. A lot of what was reported, especially early on, was false.


PATTY HAS A GUN : In February 1974, a radical organization called the SLA shocked America with the kidnapping of 19-year-old heiress Patricia Hearst. But within weeks, the young woman known to the world as ""Patty"" would do something even more disturbing: She would join her captors in their violent crimes.


PURSUIT : The 2012 murder of Faith Hedgepeth remains unsolved. Tom Gasparoli has set out to find the facts and help find justice for Faith. This podcast goes at the case hard. The murder of Faith Hedgepeth has every reason to be solved.


MURDER IN THE GRAVEYARD : September 1973 Wendy Sewell, a young legal secretary, was murdered in the town of Bakewell in Britain's Peak District. Wendy was attacked in broad daylight in Bakewell Cemetery.

SEDUCED BY SATAN : Seduced by Satan is the tale of a man who was raised in the Christian church, but in adulthood, turned to the netherworld. His God-given golden locks shaved off, teeth filed to points and face permanently marked with homemade tattoos, he dropped out of high school to pursue an education of a different type.


SEARCHING FOR RACHEL ANTONIO : Earlier this year David Murray, an investigative journalist at The Courier-Mail and author of The Murder of Allison Baden-Clay, was contacted by the family of Rachel Antonio - a teenage girl who went missing in Queensland 18 years ago.

THE DISAPPEARENCE OF AMANDA JONES : In August 2005, a pregnant Jefferson County, Missouri woman disappeared. Amanda Jones' family says she went to meet Bryan Westfall, the man she believed to be the father of her unborn child. She never returned home.


THE DISAPPEARENCE OF DES : On the morning of August 2nd 1979, Desmond Francis Carr went to work alone on a road in outback Western Australia. 40 years on and he has never been seen again.


THE DISTRICT : This is a crime podcast with a difference. It centres on an infamous, unsolved murder case in rural New Zealand. But it's a story mostly about people, people who are trying to get on with their lives but can't.


ATLANTIC : the Unsolved Mystery of Peter Bergmann : June 2009, a man calling himself Peter Bergmann checked into a Sligo hotel. Five days later his body was found on Rosses Point beach. Despite thousands of hours of police investigations, his true identity remains unknown.


THE STORYTELLER : Murder Most Foul : A young woman's body is found face down behind her door in the upmarket west end of the Granite City, Aberdeen.

...The Innocence Project, which is representing Reed, has reported on a litany of evidentiary and procedural problems that suggest Reed was convicted despite his innocence. Three forensic experts for the state filed formal affidavits explaining that the estimated time of death presented by prosecutors at trial was inaccurate, which ""makes the timeline for Reed killing Stites implausible,"" the Innocence Project notes.

""The Texas Department of Public Safety (who employed the State's expert Karen Blakely), the Bode Cellmark Forensics Laboratory (who employed the State's retained expert Meghan Clement), and the State's forensic pathologist Dr. Roberto Bayardo, have all now acknowledged that the scientific opinions offered by the State to tie Mr. Reed to the murder were in error,"" Reed's 2018 appeal reads.

That appeal was denied.

""My estimate of time of death, again, was only an estimate, and should not have been used at trial as an accurate statement of when Ms. Stites died,"" wrote Bayardo in his affidavit. The pathologist originally approximated her death occurred at 3:30 a.m. on April 23, 1996. ""If the prosecuting attorneys had advised me that they intended to use my time of death estimate as a scientifically reliable opinion of when Ms. Stites died, I would have advised them not to do so.""

And that advisement may have turned the case on its head. Forensic pathologist Dr. Michael Baden, whose account has been bolstered by three other medical experts, testified in October 2017 that ""to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, [Stites] was dead before midnight.""

That's significant, as Stites' fiancé Jimmy Fennell said the two were together at home during that time. Fennell, who was sentenced to 10 years in prison for rape in 2007, has been the subject of growing suspicion in recent years. His former cellmate, Arthur Snow, submitted an affidavit on October 29 of this year in which he testified that Fennell confessed to the murder during a private conversation between the two. Stites was allegedly engaged in an affair with Reed, a black man, which incensed Fennell as he prepared for his impending marria to Stites.

""I had to kill my nigger-loving fiancée,"" Snow claims Fennell told him. Reed and Stites' consensual sexual relationship has been corroborated by Stites' cousin, who submitted an affidavit in 2016 admitting that she knew of their relationship prior to her death. And Fennell, a former police officer, told a colleague about the affair as well.

The state's case always hinged on one piece of DNA evidence: Reed's semen, which was found inside Stites' body. No one came forward to confirm their relationship at trial, so prosecutors framed the evidence as an assault.

In that vein, there is new evidence available to the state for DNA testing, including Stites' clothing and the belt used to strangle her. (Half of the murder weapon was found next to Fennell's truck.) But the state won't test it, and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to take a closer look at the matter. Current precedent from the high court holds that defendants have no constitutional right to DNA testing, The Appeal notes, leaving people like Reed at the mercy of state courts or the prosecutors who have a vested interest in keeping them locked up—or worse.",2,1574481057.0,False,https://reddit.com/r/texas/comments/e09k9l/rodney_reed_case_assigned_new_judge/f8d7z46/,t1_f8d77x7,5

e09k9l,f8daj1o,MrHistor,">""to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, [Stites] was dead before midnight.""

We know for a fact that Stites died after 3:00AM because she left for work at that time. Her mother always stayed up to make sure Stacy wasn't late for work. Moreover, Stacey was found in her work clothes, with her name tag and her knee brace (which was stuffed with tissue to prevent chafing).

>Fennell, who was sentenced to 10 years in prison for rape in 2007, has been the subject of growing suspicion in recent years.

Why is it relevant that Fennell raped a woman a decade later, but not relevant that Reed had been a serial rapist for over a decade, that he raped/attempted to rape two women within 6 months of Stite's murder or that his DNA (including fresh saliva) was all over and inside her body?

>""I had to kill my n*gger-loving fiancée,"" Snow claims Fennell told him.

A second hand account is worthless. Fennell might have said that, he might not have, but the evidence doesn't support that. His alibi is airtight, they investigated him for months before Reed was even a suspect and couldn't find any holes in it. He was at home when Stacey's mother got the call at 6:30AM. We know the truck was dumped in the high school around 5:30AM and that is 35miles away from Fennell's apartment (only 1/6 of a mile from Reed's home). The police checked taxi records, interviewed his friends and check the mileage on all police vehicles and nothing. Moreover, the seat and mirrors of the truck were adjusted for someone of Reed's height (6'2"") and Reed's fresh saliva was found on Stacey's back brace, inside the truck.

>The state's case always hinged on one piece of DNA evidence: Reed's semen, which was found inside Stites' body. 

That's just a lie. Sure they had his semen, but they also had his fresh saliva. 

>Dr. Johnson's DQ-Alpha testing on the saliva from breast swabs taken by Blakley yielded the same results as the previous testing conducted by DPS. On the swab taken from Stacey's left breast, testing indicated 1.2, 4.1, and 3 alleles, and on the swab taken from Stacey right breast, testing indicated 1.2, 3, and 4.1 alleles. Dr. Johnson conceded that in all of the sixteen sites tested in this case, Reed could not be excluded as the donor of the semen and saliva found on Stacey's body.

I'm also not sure why you'd take the word of a serial rapist who raped/attempted to rape 2 women within 6 months of Stite's murder that he was in a consensual relationship with her. Even of he had been in a relationship with her, we know that doesn't mean much, he's raped and brutalized people he was involved with before. He even raped one woman in front of their children.

>In that vein, there is new evidence available to the state for DNA testing, including Stites' clothing and the belt used to strangle her.

They can't test the belt and the defence already knows this and they know why. Testing for touch DNA wasn't a thing at the time so they didn't take any precautions to preserve DNA or prevent contamination, because the techniques for testing hadn't been invented yet. The belt was handled (ungloved) by dozens of people, including the jurors.

>Half of the murder weapon was found next to Fennell's truck.

You say that like it's evidence, but Stacey and Fennell only had one vehicle and Stacey took it to work the morning she was murdered.

You make it sound like Fennell kicked a dog, and didn't take a woman to a public park in his patrol car and violently rape her at gunpoint.

>>In 2007, then Georgetown PD Sgt. Jimmy Fennell, Jr., kidnapped a 20-year-old woman he'd encountered while on duty and answering a call, telling her he was going to give her a ride to meet up with her boyfriend. Instead, he took her to a park, slammed her against the rear quarter-panel of his patrol vehicle, pulled out his gun, put it by her head, and raped her.

>>After he finished his assault, he told her she'd better keep her mouth shut – or else, when he was released from prison, he would ""hunt me down and he would kill me,"" the woman recalled for filmmaker Ryan Polomski, in an interview to be included in an as-yet-unfinished follow-up to his 2006 documentary, State v. Reed. The woman, who has never been publicly identified, told Polomski, in a phone conversation recorded earlier this month, that she does not believe it was the first time Fennell had done such a thing. They were in a public park, in plain sight, and he was not nervous; he was aggressive and angry, but also at ease. ""He didn't act like it was his first time being mean and hateful toward a woman,"" she said. ""He was angry, especially when I told him no. It made him mad, extremely mad.”

>>In fact, she said, his demeanor before, during, and after assaulting her led her to believe he might be capable of much more violence – including the 1996 murder of his then-fiance, 19-year-old Stacey Stites. ""Absolutely; absolutely I do, 120%, based off of what Jimmy Fennell, Jr. has done to me and the experience I went through with him, I think that man is more than capable of murder,"" she said.

Stacey was raped before she was murdered. She didn't have sex with her fiance, because she was at the point with her birth control pills that were vitamins... not birth control pills. 

Jimmy has a record of a terrible person. But there is no way anyone who reads the court transcript can really come away with an idea that Jimmy killed Stacey.  That only happens if you watch Dr. Phil and ignore the world of obvious evidence.

We are to believe that Stacey was going to have sex with someone whose affair is something that only his close friends and family could attest to during the trial.  So along with telling her fiance, her sister and her mother that she was so excited about the upcoming wedding, Stacey took the pre-dawn shift to earn an extra 50 cents an hour to buy the wedding dress that she was focused on and weeks away from wearing.

She was found in her uniform. Was she dressed in her uniform after she was killed in her apartment?
